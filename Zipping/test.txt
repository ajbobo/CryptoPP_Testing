| INTRO BLURB | #AQINTRODUC
\-------------/
Hello, and welcome to my Aquaria guide. When finished, this will hopefully be
pretty much all the info on Aquaria you'd ever want. Plus a lot more.

So, Aquaria. Released at the end of 2007 by Bit Blot, a small indie game
studio, quickly became my favorite indie game of all time. The day it came out,
I played it for 14 hours straight, before succumbing to fatigue. Fun times.

Anyway, it's a kind of cross between a Metroid game and Ecco the Dolphin for
the Sega Genesis. In it, you play as Naija, an underwater denizen who wakes up
one day, her memory gone. As you play the game, you find out more and more
about her past and about the the world of Aquaria, which keeps drawing you back
time and again.

You can purchase it, or download the free demo, from:
http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/

I highly suggest you give it a go guide-free at first. Most of the fun in
games like this come from exploring and discovering things on your own.
However, there are several puzzles in the game, and if you do get stuck,
that's what this guide is for.

Note this guide used a search code system, each part of the guide has a #CODE.
Just search for this #CODE and you will come to the part of the guide you need!

So, enough about the game, lets get this started.

17 April 09 - Finished! Two more playthroughs and like 40,000 words later,
              it's all done. If you find anything wrong, or have something to
              add, or a general comment or question or rant, my email address
              is in the notice at the top of the guide. Woo!

12 April 09 - Started writing the actual guide part, although I already have
              the enemy, boss and recipe lists done after playing through the
              game again on a whim. Noticed there were no full guides out
              there, so lets remedy this!

| PREMISE | #AQPREMISE
\---------/
As mentioned, you play as Naija, a sea creature of unknown origin or species.
She wakes up alone in a secret cave, not remembering anything about who she
is or where she came from. As you play, you might uncover secrets about her
past, and about the world she lives in. Who is she? Who is that shadowy guy?
What was that? Where am I? What time is it? Who goes there? What is Love?
All these questions and more may or may not be answered as you play.. Aquaria.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/----------\
| CONTROLS | #AQCONTROL
\----------/

Okay so, Aquaria offers a choice when it comes to controls. You have two ways
of moving Naija and interacting with the world - mouse, and keyboard. Or a
combination of both.

I prefer to use a combination of both, but it's really up to you. Experiment
with the controls until you find a scheme that works for you, as you'll really
need to be comfortable with the controls against some of the later challenges.

First, here are the things Naija can do, and what they are used for:

Swim     Being an underwater game, swimming is your basic form of movement.
Sprint   Naija will speed up for a second. Also called charging. This is useful
         for getting out of the way, and if you sprint into a wall or similar
         object Naija will cling onto it.
Spin     Naija will spin in place. This has several uses throughout the game,
         and will be explained when appropriate.
Special  Your default special is singing.
Look     When pressed, the look key will focus the screen on the mouse cursor.
         This is handy to see things far away from Naija without alerting
         them to her presence.

There are many more controls, but those are your basics. I will go over the
others in the General Tips section later.


| MOUSE |
Swim     Left click and hold, Naija will swim in the direction of the cursor.
Sprint   Double click and hold.
Spin     Hold the left mouse button and rotate it around Naija rapidly.
Special  Right click and hold.
Look     Middle mouse button/wheel click and hold.

| KEYBOARD |
Note: All keyboard controls can be changed in the Key Config menu.
Swim     The WASD keys control Naija, as well as the UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT keys.
         Holding two, for instance W and A or UP and LEFT, will make Naija
         swim diagonally.
Sprint   Tap the space bar while holding down a direction key.
Sprin    Press and hold R.
Special  Press the CTRL key.
Look     Press and hold E.


As I said, experiment with the controls to get a scheme you are comfortable
with. You can also use partly keyboard and partly mouse.

Personally, I use WASD for movement and spinning, the space bar for
sprinting, and the mouse for special abilities. This is just personal choice,
you won't know what works for you until you try!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/-------------\
| WALKTHROUGH | #AQWALKTHR
\-------------/

And so it begins. I'll just quickly explain how this walkthrough will work.
If you follow this guide from start to finish, you'll get and see everything.
However, if you just want to finish the game, I will mark the optional areas
as such, and you can skip them.

This walkthrough will not be spoiler free, as I will list all enemies, recipes
and treasures obtainable in an area when we first enter it.

Again, I heavily suggest you play through the game once on your own, as the
magic of Aquaria is in the unknown.

Okay, you're still reading. Here we go.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We start on a cutscene, where Naija explains to the player that we are reliving
her memories through gameplay. We then cut to the Verse Cave, where she tells
us she is lonely and restless. Lets see if we can fix that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/------------\
| VERSE CAVE | #AQWALK001
\------------/
ENEMIES:       Tiny Jellyfish

Begin by learning to control Naija. Swim, sprint, and spin. Take a look at the
map (Q on the keyboard, or double clicking the minimap). When you are ready,
swim to the tunnel.

One thing you'll notice is the tunnel is dark, and the minimap goes black. You
cannot access your map in dark areas.

As you follow the path, you'll unlock a blue map token. These are pretty
pointless, but if you ever forget where you started the game, you can just
look for the blue map token.

In the next clearing, you'll find some Tiny Jellyfish. These are harmless. The
game will then teach you how to sing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SINGING |    Right click, or press CTRL, to start singing. Each coloured
               symbol is a note, move the mouse onto them to sing that note.
               For the purposes of this guide, I will be referring to notes as
               colours. From the top, going clockwise, you have:
               Red, Purple, Blue, Aqua, Green, Yellow, Brown, Orange.
               To sing, move your mouse over these notes in order. However, at
               the moment you do not know any songs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of this little cavern, you will also find a Song Stem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SONG PLANT | Song plants are little coloured bulbs that contain items, such
               as ingredients or food. To open them, sing a note the same
               colour as the bulb. You'll know if you get the right note, as
               the bulb will quiver for a few seconds, then burst. Be aware,
               some contain enemies! Or even weirder things. Not usually,
               though. Bulbs always contain the same item each playthrough,
               however, their colour is randomized.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bulb here contains an Eel Oil. If you take the right path, it will lead to
a dead-end with a large boulder, and a Small Egg in a song plant. We'll return
here later.

Take the south path and follow it, and a white circle will appear on your
minimap. This is a map change area, continue in the tunnel to reach the next
area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/---------------------\
| SECRET CAVE PASSAGE | #AQWALK002
\---------------------/
ENEMIES:       Shrimp, Blue Jellyfish, Crotoid, Tiny Jellyfish, Crab, Fish
ITEMS:         Hand Roll, Hot Soup

As you proceed, the game will tell you how to Look. Take a look at the harmless
Shrimp that somehow got stuck in an unreachable cave. Poor things.

As you swim down, you'll come to a fork. However, the right passage is blocked.
Take the left. In the next opening you will come across a harmless Blue
Jellyfish, and a song plant containing a Hand Roll!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| RECIPES |    Aquaria features a robust cooking system, combining ingredients
               into consumable food items with various effects. There are two
               ways of finding new recipes: experiment, mix things together,
               and hope for the best, or find already-made food items inside
               song plants. Picking up a food item teaches you the recipe
               automatically. Recipes are found, surprisingly, on the Recipe
               page in your menu. For a list of all recipes, see the Cooking
               guide at the end of the walkthrough.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you proceed down the passageway, you'll find a current. For now, you can
only follow the currents, so let them wash you further into the area.

The game will then teach you how to Sprint, and stick some Crotoids in your
path. Sprint past them, as you currently have no way of defending yourself.

Swim through another current to find some Health Plants. These glowing blue
plants just need to be touched to heal wounds. You need to leave an return
to the area for them to replenish, however. Continue on.

After the next current, you will learn the Shield Song.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SHIELD SONG | BROWN - BLUE - BROWN - BLUE
                The Shield Song is the first song you learn, given to you
                automatically. It surrounds you in a protective shield, which
                can reflect some energy blast attacks. It does not, however,
                protect you from physically touching an enemy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sing it now to make sure you understand the singing system - it's simply brown,
blue, brown, blue, so move the mouse side to side over the correct notes. Naija
will have a glowing purpley blue circle around her if you did it right.

Avoid the Crab in the next passage, and stay north. Avoid the blasts of the
Raspberry on the rock there, or reflect them with the shield. To the left,
you'll find a current - you can actually swim through this one, as it is weak.
You'll come to a song plant on the other side of that rock we saw earlier -
the plant contains the Hot Soup recipe. Go back through the current now and
head south, taking care to avoid the Raspberrys and their blasts.

You'll come to your first save crystal - these are the large red crystals
you'll find throughout your adventure. Right click one while nearby to save.
If you ever die, you will restart from your last save, so make sure to save
as often as possible!

Swim left, and soon a shadowy figure will emerge from the Save Point and
swim past. Swim towards it to start.. something.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/----------------\
| HORRIBLE PLACE |
\----------------/
ENEMIES:       Really horrible ones.

You'll wake up somewhere else as someone different. The map doesn't work,
and if you swim into the open cave a whole assortment of horrible things will
attack! Try your hardest to fight them, but in the end, the outcome is
inevitable...

(Note: You can actually survive this cave, and exit at the end of the 2nd large
room. However, the outcome is the same.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/---------------------\
| SECRET PASSAGE CAVE |
\---------------------/
ENEMIES:       Shrimp, Blue Jellyfish, Crotoid, Tiny Jellyfish, Crab,
               Raspberry, Fish
ITEMS:         Hearty Soup

You'll be back in the cave, and the shadowy figure will leave. Naija will try
to make sense of it, and kind of fail. It also seems all her memories are now
gone. Woo.

On the floor of the cave, is a rock. You can see this rock is eminating a
strange glow - there's a song plant behind it! Sing the note of the colour,
and grab the Heart Soup. Travel left to enter the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------\
| HOME WATERS | #AQWALK003
\-------------/
ENEMIES:       Crotoid, Shrimp, Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish, Fish
ITEMS:         Sea Cake

Swim left, and take the upper passage when you can. Avoid the Crotoid and bust
open the song plant there for 3 Plant Leaves. Swim back and continue left.

Avoid the Raspberrys, and when you come to a crossroads, continue left. There's
another song plant hiding behind a rock halfway along the passage, which
contains a Sea Cake. At the end of the passage, you'll find 2 Raspberries, some
health plants, and a song plant containing 2 Reb Bulbs. Shield up before going
in, if you are worried.

Back at the crossroads, head down. Avoid the Crotoid, and enjoy your first big
open area. There's a song plant with 2 Fish Meat in a little cave to the right,
then proceed down. The game will introduce you to Naija's home, so go inside.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/--------------\
| NAIJA'S HOME | #AQWALK004
\--------------/

Not much to do here for now. There's a Save Point (marked as a red circle on
your minimap), a cooking area that gives you a third slot to cook with,
although you do not have any recipes that complex yet. Once you are finished
exploring, leave the way you came in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------\
| HOME WATERS |
\-------------/
ENEMIES:       Crotoid, Shrimp, Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish, Fish, Eel, Seahorse,
               Tromulo, Grouper, Octopus, Scooter, Raspberry
ITEMS:         Leaf Poultice

Head down, below the entrance to Naija's House. In a little opening you will
find a song plant containing a Leaf Poultice, as well as a little seahorse
and some dangerous anemone. Watch out.

Below that, you'll meet a Tromulo, a little purple octopus. Just avoid it
for now. You'll also meet Grouper, a large harmless hungry fish. Also a song
plant containing 2 Small Eggs lays on the ocean floor. However, when you break
it, Grouper will swim down to eat them! Collect them quickly unless you want
to give him a snack.

Another enemy you may see here is Scooter, a small blue orb thing that sticks
to the walls. He can nudge into you, but he is also harmless.

Okay, to continue the game, head to the bottom right passage. Follow it
through, swimming through one current and avoiding another, past a couple of
Crotoids and a Raspberry, until you come to the... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-----------\
| SONG CAVE | #AQWALK005
\-----------/
ENEMIES:       Rock Turtle, Blue Jellyfish, Electric Jellyfish, Nudibranch,
               Shrimp, Tiny Jellyfish
ITEMS:         Hot Soup, Hand Roll, Verse Egg #1
TREASURES:     Jelly Beacon

Proceed in, and listen as Naija explains her goals. Ignore the Rock Turtle and
Blue Jellyfish, and head left at the first fork, as the right path is blocked.

Avoiding the dangerous anemones, follow the path until you come to a large open
chamber. Avoid the even more dangerous Electric Jellyfish, and take note of the
giant closed door at the bottom. Yes, that's a door. Next to it is a rock
hiding a song plant, which contains another Hot Soup.

To the left are more anemones, and a save point. Further left are more
Jellyfish, a shelled Nudibranch, a song plant containing a Hand Roll, and a
giant ceiling anemone. You cannot do anything with it yet.

Head back right, past the door, through a current, then head down. Paying
no attention to the shrimp and Blue Jellyfish, you'll find another rock,
almost completely disguising a Leaf-Poultice-containing song plant. Head right.

The song plant on the right-most wall contains 2 Eel Jelly, and then if you
follow the path all the way to the end, you'll come across some ancient mural
on the wall.

It contains the same symbol as the door, with some creature apparently
vomitting on it. Or.. singing? Also included are 4 notes, Aqua, Purple,
Yellow, Orange. Aha.

To get back to the door, you'll have to  take the bottom left passage. Not
much to talk about here, just avoid the Rock Turtle. If you go to the bottom
of the deepest chasm, however, you'll find an Electric Jellyfish and a scary
statue. Was that a chuckle? Oh well. Head back up to find the save point,
then go right to the door.

NOTE: Worth noting at this point is that using a save point refills your
health for free. So always use a save point whenever you come across one.

Okay, so we are back at the door. Apparently vomitting on the door is a
good idea? When have ancient murals ever been wrong? Well, there's no
vomit key, but we can sing. Sing the 4 notes you saw on the wall to open
the door. 

The notes were Aqua, Purple, Yellow and Orange if you forgot. Swim into
the now open doorway.

Swim right, and the game will take over for a second. You can't get to
that egg yet, so continue right and swim to the big blue crystal.

Cutscene! After it's over, it seems the pink fishwoman ghost thing has
taught you a new song. The Bind Song!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BIND SONG | GREEN - AQUA - BLUE
              The Bind Song does just that, it binds an item to Naija. Usable
              items include rocks of the small or large persuasion, small
              plants, creatures shells, etc. Experiment with it, as it will
              be one of your most used songs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you try it where you stand, you'll bind a small rock. Sing the song again
to unbind. Head left a few spaces, and you'll see two plant leaves on the wall.
You may have noticed these before, too. Try your bind song here, and the plant
will rip out, revealing an ingredient! this is a good way of getting a few
choice ingredients, such as Small Bones, Plant Leaves, Red Bulbs and Berries,
and Plant Bulbs. Also note enemies may be waiting inside, just like Song
Plants. Also worth noting is the contents are random, so I won't be guiding
you on them. I did manage to find some Small Bones, Red Berries, Plant
Leaves and a Healing Poultice in the Song Cave, though! Keep your own eyes
peeled.

Head down into that chasm, and Bind the rock to you. Move it out of the way,
and move into the chasm to find your first Verse Egg! Sing it's colour to
crack it, much like a song plant, then absorb the health released for a
permanent health upgrade. Head back through the door to the main Song Cave.

If you head right, and go to the most upper-right portion of the cave, you
will find a song plant containing a Special Bulb. These are very rare
ingredients used for very high level recipes, so I'll be giving them
special mention. If you head up, into the very top right of the cave,
you'll find your first Treasure, the Jelly Beacon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| TREASURE | 
              Treasures are useless but interesting items Naija finds
              throughout her journey. When you find a treasure, just touch it
              to pick it up. Naija will magically teleport it back to her
              house, where it will show up and maybe have some effect. For
              instance, the Jelly Beacon attracts a few Tiny Jellyfish into
              Naija's House. I won't be listing the effects of each treasure,
              so check the Treasure Menu in-game or look around Naija's House
              to find out what each one does.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also note there are many plants to be bound in this area. Once done exploring,
head left to find that blocked passage from earlier. Now you can Bind the rock
out of the way, and proceed through!

Proceed back to the entrance of the cave, and leave. On the way, bind some
more plants for some goodies, and note the game tells you you can bind shells
off of protected creatures. Try it on the Rock Turtle here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| HOME WATERS |
\-------------/
ENEMIES:       Crotoid, Shrimp, Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish, Fish, Eel, Seahorse,
               Tromulo, Grouper, Octopus, Scooter, Raspberry

Now you have your new-found ability, you may feel like exploring to your hearts
content. That's fine, but for the purposes of this guide we are going to get
one more ability before doing any optional stuff.

Head back to the area around Naija's Home, using the currents. Again, be
careful of the Raspberrys. Once there, head for the exit to the left and
slightly below Naija's home. You'll know you're in the right place when you see
some orange lamps lighting the way, and some actual architecture.

Swim past the ominous looking statue, and Bind the rock to pull it aside.
Continue on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| THE ENERGY TEMPLE | #AQWALK006
\-------------------/
ENEMIES:       Raspberry, Moneye Squid, Crotoid, Nautilus, Blaster Peg, Turret
               Scooter, Trillious, Newtblaster, Froog, Tromulo, Energy Shrimp
ITEMS:         Leaf Poultice, Spicy Roll
TREASURES:     Tooth

Glide on, past the save point, past the crack in the ground, past the current
vent, past the odd statue holding a pearl, into the chamber.

The door will close behind you, and a miniboss fight will start.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Energy Statue
Location:       Energy Temple
Attacks:        Energy Bolts - When you hurt it, it fires energy bolts at you.
                The more you damage it, the more bolts it fires.
Tactics:        First up, cast shield. Check your menu if you forgot how to
                sing it. Second, wait for the little energy bolt thing to sing,
                then repeat the note he does. Hold it for a second or two and
                it'll get annoyed and try to blast you. This is where shield
                comes in handy, you reflect the bolts! Try blowing up the 4
                energy crystals around the edge of the room with reflected
                bolts for fun. After several rounds of repeating the energy
                bolt's notes, it'll die and the statue itself will sing a
                song. Repeat this song to end the encounter!
Rewards:        Energy Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ENERGY FORM | YELLOW - BROWN - ORANGE
              The Energy Form allows Naija to hurl blasts of energy at her
              foes using the right click or ctrl buttons. If you hold the
              the button down, Naija charges up, and when fully charged, she
              can launch three blasts at once. These blasts also home in, and
              you can even lock onto a specific enemy by hovering the cursor
              over them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you are now the energy being you were in the nightmare near the start of
the game. Time to explain another part of the controls:

Using the keyboard, you can quickly change form by using the 1-8 keys. At the
moment, 1 is Song Form and 2 is Energy Form. 9 is Shield and 0 is Bind, too.
The X key also changes you back to Song Form. This is much quicker than
singing, but also takes part of the challenge out of the game. How you use
the controls is up to you.

Okay, back to the temple. Leave via the open left hand door, then swim up,
since the path left is blocked by rubble. At the top, Naija will explain how
to fight, and you can try out your new abilities on the Raspberrys there.

NOTE: Killed enemies have a chance to leave behind little blue sparkly bits.
This, like the blue health plants, restores your health.

Continuing on, Naija will explain charging shots, and you'll be introduced to
Moneye Squids. Little one-eyed things that swim about, constantly spawning from
their nest. Take out their nest to stop their onslaught, and make sure to pick
up any small eggs and eyes they drop.

In this large room, if you switch back to Song Form and Bind the rock in the
lower passage, you can find some Crotoids and a song plant containing a Leaf
Poultice.

Continue back on the main path, fighting off some more Raspberries and a lone
Nautilus until you come to the next area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this next area, above where you come in are several Blaster Pegs. These are
good for trying out your new combat abilities on, as they are quite agile.

Lower in the tunnel, you will come across a blue barrier. This can only be
crossed in Song Form, so switch back. Then, an orange barrier. Can you guess?
Yes, switch to Energy Form to pass. Kill the Turrets on the walls while you are
at it.

Lower still you'll find a small off-shoot to the right, this contains a Scooter
and a health plant, so continue downwards.

Pass through 2 more song barriers to the very bottom of this tunnel. You will
see 2 of those pearl-holding statues here. Lock onto one, charge a full blast
and let go. The pearl will glow orange, and the door opens! Do this for both,
and head right first. Inside is a song plant with the Spicy Roll recipe inside.

In the left now-unlocked room, you'll find two Blue Jellyfish. These always
drop large health when killed, and often drop Jelly Oil, a valuable ingredient,
too. Take them out, then head back up to the only passage you have not taken.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this new area, take out the Trillious and unlock the door by blasting the
pearl with a charged shot. In the next chamber, you'll find two empty pearl
sockets, and get attacked by Nautilus. Clear them out, and then start finding
those pearls.

We'll start with the easier one - head up, defeat the Newtblaster, and head
into the top right room. Take out the Froogs and head up, Binding the pearl
when you find it. Take it down to one of the empty pedestals and it'll slot
into place. One down, one to go. If you take the upper left route, you'll
meet a Tromulo and find a save point. When ready, take the lower left path.

In the next few rooms, be aware of the energy barriers that turn on and off.
Only pass when they are off, as touching them hurts. Take out the Nautilus in
the second room, and beware of the Shocker in the third.

Head through the collapsed ceiling and all the way through the tunnel, minding
the Raspberrys and playing with the Nudibranch in the little off-shoot if you
wish.

Mind the Shocker around the next corner, and heal with the Blue Jellies in the
next little cave if need be. At the end, take out the Crotites and the Turret,
the Newtblaster and the Moneye Shrimp, and unlock the door. Continue right, as
the path down is blocked, and deal with the Newtblaster and Shocker at the
end.

Past the horizontal energy barrier, deal with the Tromulo and Energy Shrimp.
At the end of the optional south passage, you'll find a Blue Jelly and a song
plant containing 2 Plant Leaves. Head past where the Energy Shrimp were
guarding, past the Rock Turtle, to find the second pearl! Bind it, and drag
it aaaaaaaall the way back. Yep, through two long tunnels and several rooms.
Past the energy barriers. Go on, go ahead, I'll wait.

Okay, done? Charge both pearls to unlock the doors, and proceed down. In the
dark little offshoot you'll find another save point, then head down again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head down, d-d-d-down, to face...

Boss:           Fallen God
Location:       Energy Temple
Required Forms: Energy
Attacks:        Let's Get Physical - When you are within range, it occasionally
                lunges and bites at you.
                Let's Get Physical 2 - More often than not, however, it will
                simply reel back then swipe at you. Dodge backwards to avoid
                it.
                Energy Blasts - It also fires 3 slow non-homing energy blasts
                at you when you are out of melee range.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          Flashing yellow doesn't mean he's taking damage, however it
                does make him move back. Maybe he's guarding something?
                Force fields don't just hurt you.
Guide:          This fight contains two parts. The first part requires you to
                blast the God as much as possible to make him move back. This
                reveals a pearl he was guarding. When the God is far enough
                back, switch to song form and Bind the pearl. Take it far to
                the right to find a socket for it. Once it is in it's socket,
                change back to energy form. Now comes the second part of the
                fight. Move to wherever the God is, he should still be at the
                back firing energy balls at you. Get close enough to him so
                that he swipes for you, then dart back to the right. After
                swiping he'll crawl towards you. Repeat this all the way up
                to the pearl, then blast the pearl (right-click to charge,
                move the mouse over the pearl then fire). This will activate a
                force field that will shock the boss if he is in contact with
                it. Doing this will move him back and damage him, forcing you
                to lure him into it a second time. Once you have done it two
                times, he wises up and stops just short of the force field when
                you try to lure him. To hit him this one final time, you need
                to move close, get him to swipe at you, then activate the
                force field while his arm is in range of it. This will shock
                him a 3rd and final time, killing him for good.
Rewards:        A vision, a treasure, and a way out of the temple.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you pick up the TOOTH after the fight. Head left and into the gap in
the ceiling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the path, blasting the Blue Jellies. You cannot deal with the empty peal
pedestal or the giant red flower bud yet, so keep going to find yourself back
at the entrance to the Energy Temple. Go right, to find yourself back in...

ENEMIES:       Crotoid, Shrimp, Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish, Fish, Eel, Seahorse,
               Tromulo, Grouper, Octopus, Scooter, Raspberry, Octopus

Okay, so we ransacked an ancient temple, looted the treasure and survived. Head
back to Naija's House, then under it, around the other side, and to the very
top. Head into the little dead-end cave there in the top-right by moving the
rock, and at the very back you'll find an Ancient Sea Turtle. These guys act as
the fast-transport system of Aquaria, and when you find another one you will be
able to travel back and forth very quickly. Now, come back out, and head down.

Past one passageway, you'll find another little dead-end cave with two
Raspberrys and a pearl. Bind the pearl, and head back out. There is a cloaked
Octopus outside this cave, and can be very surprising when you first see him.
You can take him out with Energy Form, and he is not actually much of a
threat, as he just tends to squirt ink at you and run away. If you do manage
to defeat him, he'll cough up several Rubbery Meat and Small Tentacles,
though.

Regardless, with pearl in tow, head to that passageway you skipped, just above
the dead-end cave. Swim down it, avoiding the Tromulos, and snap the pearl into
its holder. Charge it up to open the door to the next area!

Now, this is a good time to get some optional stuff done. If you do not wish to
do that, just seach for #AQWALK007, which will follow the optional stuff
directly.

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Big Seed, Baby Nautilus Egg, Krotite Armor

Okay, lets start with the Big Seed. Head back to the Verse Cave, the
area you started in. If you forgot where it is, check your map. It's the cave
at the end of the long passage above the one you are in currently, through
Secret Passage Cave. Head back there now.

ENEMIES:       Tiny Jellyfish
TREASURE:      Big Seed

Remember that dead-end we came to earlier? The one with the song plant we
opened, and the suspicious looking rock? It's the one on the right side of the
map. Go there, and bind the rock. The Big Seed treasure is behind it.

Pick it up, and head back to Home Waters.

ENEMIES:       Crotoid, Shrimp, Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish, Fish, Eel, Seahorse,

               Aggrohopper
TREASURE:      Baby Nautilus Egg

Yes, there is quite a bit of backtracking in Aquaria for secret items, but it's
worth it, in my opinion. Anyway, take a look at your map. There should only be
two passages still greyed out, unless you already did any freelance exploring.

Your target is the large cavern on the lefthand side of the map, the one that
is connected to the main cavern via 2 tunnels. Head there, bind the rock, and
move in. At the top of this very cavern, lurks the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Nautilus Prime
Location:       Home Waters
Attacks:        Spinning Around - Like all Nautilus, it constantly spins
                around. This is more of a key point of the Prime Nautilus
                however, as it's weak point is only in line with you for a
                short time.
                Spawn! - It can spawn a bunch of baby Nautilus and will
                continue to do so throughout the fight.
                Charge! - Also like all Nautilus, when it gets within range of
                you it stops for a second then charges at you at full speed.
                Energy Bolts - It fires several small purple homing energy
                bolts at you regularly throughout the fight.
Critical Mode:  Once it goes red, it swims much faster and fires many, many
                more energy bolts.
                It also appears to spawn less babies, but they are still there.
Hints:          If you don't have anything to shoot him with, you're going to
                have a hard time.
Guide:          It's a good idea to wait until you have the Energy Form to do
                this thing, but apparently it is possible with rocks. You'd
                need to be insanely good, though. Anyway, once you have Energy
                Form and a lot of courage, go into its area. To make the fight
                a lot easier, switch to song form and pick up the rock near the
                entrance. You can keep this bound even in Energy Form and it
                makes the fight a lot smoother. So, with rock in tow, go near
                this big mama and lock onto it. Fire a blast into its face and
                the fight will begin!
                Swim around it in either direction, and keep charging up
                blasts. Release them when you are sure they will hit its face
                rather than its shell, any blasts that hit its shell are
                wasted. Half the blasts will still probably hit the smaller
                Nautilus, but that doesn't matter. The rock you are towing will
                keep the smaller Nautilus from attacking you, and will even
                deflect the Nautilus Prime if it happens to charge into the
                rock rather than you! Once you hit it enough it will go red
                and start firing a lot more energy bolts at you. Don't be put
                off, just keep swimming in circles around it and firing bolts
                at its face until it gives up! Keep in mind the blue jellyfish
                around the bottom of the area. If you do need a quick health
                boost, charge down to them and destroy them quickly. This is a
                bit risky, however, and it's much safer to just cure with food
                items.
Rewards:        Baby Nautilus Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've beaten the big momma Nautlius, and gotten the egg (make sure to
wait around for it to hatch, or it won't count!), or given up, head to the
bottom of the little cave underneath you for a Leaf Poultice in a song plant,
being careful of the Aggrohopper nearby.

Once all that's done, down, as if you were heading to Song Cave, but head left
instead. Move the rock out of the way, and grab the Hot Soup from the song
plant, then charge up the pearl and head inside.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, this is technically The Energy Temple again, but we'll only be here a
moment so I won't brand it as a new area. Basically, all you have to do here is
swim up, avoiding the Crotoids and Aggrohoppers until you get to the top. Nab
the Krotite Armor, don it, if you want (go to Treasures menu, highlight it,
then click Use), then head back down and out.

This is actually it for sidequests at the moment, the areas we have seen do yet
still hold more secrets, but they shall have to wait. Head back to where you
opened the last pearl gate, before starting this optional stuff. It's at the
top right of Home Waters. Head through to come to...

ENEMIES:       Oarfish, Fish, Raspberry, Moneye Squid, Blue Jellyfish
               Castle Crab
ITEMS:         Hand Roll

Welcome to Open Waters. Open Waters actually consists of 5 maps, and they are
not numbered in-game. However, for backtracking purposes, I will be. This is
Open Waters 1.

Swim onwards, ignoring the poor helpless Oarfish, and hitting the save point.
Take the path down, but only far enough to find a song plant containing some
plant leaves. Then head right, through the tunnel. In the next big room,
avoid or kill the Raspberrys and continue pushing right to find a big statue
Naija comments on. Follow the path further right still.

After a few currents, you'll find a rock at the bottom of the area covering
a song plant, which contains another Hand Roll. Continue right to meet the
Castle Crabs, either ignore or defeat them too before pressing on.

When you come to a split, head right. You CAN go up, right now, and do a lot
of business up there, before going right. This is up to you, and a lot of
people do choose to go up, as the area to the right leads to a pretty hard
dungeon. However, for the purposes of this guide, we are going to go right
first, as it saves time in the longrun.

ENEMIES:       Rockhead, Baby Aggrohopper, Tabar, Nautilus, Blaster Peg
               Raspberry, Moneye Squid, Blue Jellyfish, Shrimp, Castle Crab
               Ekritt
ITEMS:         Spicy Roll, Healing Poultice
               

Follow the path right and down, past the invincible Rockhead fish. You'll come
across some other new enemies next, some Baby Aggrohoppers and a nest, as well
as a Tabar. And a good ol' fashioned Nautilus. You'll come to a song plant
that contains two Sea Loaves before fighting more Castle Crabs.

Press on into the large room to do battle with several Nautlius, Blaster Pegs,
Raspberrys and Moneye Squids. You're aiming for the lower left passage,
although there is a song plant with a Spicy Meat in it near a Moneye Squid nest
to the right. In the little offshoot from the bottom left passage, you'll find
a Blue Jelly and a save point.

Follow the path right and down, past many Castle Crab and Raspberrys, but then
turn left at the split. At the far far end of this passage, past more enemies,
is a Song Plant containing another useful Spicy Roll. Once you have picked
that up, head back to the split and follow the currents right.

Follow the passage up and right, but stick to the left wall. Part of the way
up, you'll find a passage blocked by rocks. Remove these, defeat the Castle
Crab therein, and follow it to the end for a song plant containing a Healing
Poultice.

Once you've nabbed that handy item, head out and straight right, into the
passage. If you meet the Ekritt out here, don't be worried, he's harmless.
Smash the pots on the way down the passage for some (not-so) goodies.

\-----------------------/
ENEMIES:       Toad, Moray Eel, Splitter, Fish, Huggy, Dark Jellyfish, Seahorse
               Armored Flea
ITEMS:         Spicy Roll, Hearty Soup, Sea Cake

Okay, this place isn't exactly easy to write a guide for, but here goes. First
up, be on guard for Toads and their projectiles everywhere here. They can be a
pain for new players. Also watch out for the Moray Eels in their habitats, they
have surprising range and speed.

Head right, and at the first chance head up and left. Continue hugging the left
wall and you'll find a song plant with a Spicy Roll in it. Head up a bit, and
you'll find one of these globe houses doesn't have a roof on it. You can enter
these ones. Do so to this one to find some fish and a smashable pot containing
a rare Glowing Egg ingredient. Head back out and continue up.

Hugging the right wall this time you'll find another song plant containing two
Plant Leaves. At the very top of this area is another open house, this one
containing a Huggy. Huggys are little leech guys with coloured eyes. If you
sing the colour the eyes are, it'll latch onto you, but, unlike most leeches,
will actually GIVE you health as long as it remains attached. Score!

Anyway, head out, and down-right. You cannot go up-right because of a strong
current. At the next split, enter a house there to procure some Rotten Meat
from a jar therein. Ignore the Dark Jellyfish you pass, he's harmless and
invincible.

Head up and right and grab the Hearty Soup from the song plant, and another
Healing Poultice from an almost totally hidden song plant in one of the
half-destroyed houses you pass. Just below that, a Moray Eel guards a song
plant that contains another Huggy!

Yet another song plant holds 2 spicy meat, this one on the bottom right wall
of this area. After grabbing those, head down and left, to another open
house, this one looking a little different. inside, you'll find a cooking
area, if you have any complex recipes, and also unlock one of Naijas's Lost
Memories! Looks like this is where Naija learned to cook.

Head out and down, follow the stream of bubbles into a house. Defeat the
Armored Fleas therein, and smash the pots for some trippy Rainbow
Mushrooms. Head out and left, at the very bottom of the dip there you'll
find a house that contains a Sea Cake trapped in a song plant.

Head out and up. One last unexplored house here will lead to a savepoint!

There are a few other unexplored houses here, but we cannot do anything in
them, yet. Head back to the house that had the Rainbow Mushrooms in, then past
it to the left. Just after the dip is another house that contains 2 Small
Tentacles in a song plant. After that, head out and right into Mithalas
proper. Unfortunately you'll have to say goodbye to any Huggys, they do not
persist between maps!

ITEMS:         Hearty Soup
TREASURE:      Mithalan Banner

Head to the first crossroads, and up. At the top, look in the top left for a
blue banner. This is actually the treasure Mithalan Banner! Now, head aaaaall
the way down. On the left is a Blue Jelly, and on the right is a passageway
covered in .. gross.. red stuff? Unfortunately, you gotta head down it.

At the end you'll find a big room full of poison vents and.. horrible mutants!
Fight them off best you can, if any enter the vents and become bloated, ignore
them. At the end you'll find a current pushing you back and a disk. Bind the
disk, and leave the way you came in. Head right at the crossroads this time.

Head to the top of the next shaft you come to, then right through the current.
Make sure not to lose the disk in the current, if you do just go bind it again.
Fight or ignore the Blazers you meet, but try to kill the pointy Lopers as they
may drop Glowing Eggs.

Head to the top of the next chamber, finding a bunch of Splitters guarding a
song plant at the top right. The plant contains a Hearty Soup. The way left
is blocked, so head back down a bit. The next passage right contains the
Princess' room, with a pot containing a Rainbow Mushroom. Head back out,
down, and right, into the throne room.

The Throne Room contains a save point, and a hole on the central throne to
place that disk you've been dragging around. After placing it, right click
the throne to sit on it and open the doorway to the next area.

ITEMS:         Spicy Roll, Tough Cake, Rotten Cake, Leeching Poultice
               Arcane Poultice

Now things get serious. This is the first real dungeon of the game, The Energy
Temple is too simple to really count. Maze-like corridoors, grotesque
minibosses and dark overtones plague this forsaken place.

Remember, you can cook at any time, so don't be afraid to use those leaves,
meat and oil you've hopefully been collecting. You'll need a plentiful supply
of food to get you through this place alive if it's your first time.

Head straight across the first room you come to, through the current into the
large main chamber. Swim straight across this one too, taking out any Rot Worms
that get in your way.

The next chamber is a square, full of currents. If you fight the current and
head straight across, you'll find a song plant containing another Spicy Roll.
Then come back out and obey the current, watching out for the diseased Crabs
that patrol the walls. Follow through into the next room, to the right.

You'll come into a large room, containing Armored Fleas, Splitters, Blazers
and even a mutant. It's very, very suggested you take this room slowly and
clear it out, for when you get halfway into the room, you'll have to face a...

                body.
Attacks:        Collision - Touching the Core will hurt you.
                Laser Vision - When an eye is shot, it will turn red and fire
                a laser straight out from it. Do not touch!
                Laser Disco - When you shoot all 6 eyes in turn, the Core will
                pivot on the spot. Stay between two lasers and spin with it to
                avoid damage.
                Rotbabies - When the Core starts to take damage, it will spawn
                some babies that home in on you - a few blasts will sort them
                out. However, if you do not take them out quickly, they will
                evolve an eye and eventually legs, too - each evolution will
                cause them to fire more and more pink blasts at you, which
                vaguely home in.
                Spin - Eventually, the lasers will stop, but the Core will move
                around the room, spinning, occasionally firing a lone laser.
Tactics:        Swim around the Core, shooting each eye in turn. Avoid it's
                Laser Disco attack, and as soon as the weak spot appears, a
                disgusting growth that extends from the creature's mouth, blast
                it to pieces! Continue blasting it until the creature dies,
                avoiding any further attacks and any Corelings it may spawn.
Rewards:        Game continuation 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have defeated it, you'll see a short cutscene of one of three gross
muscle tentacle things disappearing. If you've played this kind of game before,
you know what that means. Yep. Roll on #2.

Anyway, once you've defeated any remaining Rotbabies, you might also notice the
tentacle in the bottom right is also gone - ignore that for now, and head to
the top left. Follow the current through to a room containing a save point.

Go north another 2 rooms, then right, fighting Mutants as you go. Go down a
room, and then to the far right to find 3 pots, two containing new recipes,
the Rotten Cake and Tough Cake, and the last containing.. some Fleas. Oh
well. Head back to the room above the save point.

This time, head left, then down. Then aaaaall the way left, to a room where you
are blocked by a mean old tentacle. However, at the bottom of this tiny area
you will find a pot containing the Leeching Poultice recipe! This one cures
poison, and is well worth knowing in this place.

Go back right, up two rooms, left, down, and left. All the while fighting 
mutants. If you are in the right place, you should be near a strong current
pulling you down. Accept it, and enter the next big room. Head left slowly,
kill the Flea and the Mutant, then fight Rotted Core #2. Same tactics apply,
so I won't copy paste the guide. Once he's down, another tentacle disappears!
Hooray. Head down the newly opened path.

You are now back at the start of the Cathedral. Head right again, all the
way back to where you fought Core #1. Take that path in the bottom right I told
you to ignore before.

You'll be shot out into a room full of scary mutants. Kill the slim ones, and
ignore the fat ones. At the bottom you'll find the only exit is blocked with
fat dumby mutants - switch to Song Form and bind them, one by one, out of the
way.

Out the other side, head left as far as you can go, then down. You'll enter a
small room containing a save point, and a word of warning from Naija. Forget
that, let's keep going. Go back to the last map, and up. Play with the Moneye
Squid in their whirlpool room if you want, but eventually head left. Clear out
the room as best you can, then fight the third and last Rotted Core. Once
that's done, head down through the now open giant scary ominous face gate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save at the save point, then head into the current. This place is pretty much
continuous current, but there are a few really helpful goodies up for grabs.
At the first split, if you head up, and hug the immediate left wall, as you
start to head south, there is a tiny area out of the current that has 3 song
plants: a red berry, a plant leaf, and the extremely potent Arcane Poultice.
This thing heals you to full health! Swim back into the current.

At the next split, head up, and hug the immediate right wall. As the current
join again on the other side, there's a tiny pocket of calm water,
containing... another Arcane Poultice!

Now, the next part requires a little dexterity to gain all the items. To start,
go back into the current and hug the south wall. You'll break off to a tunnel,
then immediately hug the north wall. You'll come to a calm room, containing a
save point and a Leaf Poultice, as well as a path back to the beginning of the
Cathedral, if you want to chicken out and leave.

If you aren't, however, head down, and let the current carry you down, then
left, then aaaaall the way around. This time, do not hug the south wall, and
keep going. Once past the branch you took last time, however, hug left, to find
one more Arcane Poultice. If you miss it, you'll have to come back for it
later, as you don't get another chance now. Let the current wash you past more
Rotbabies and about 1028 Fleas, into a calm room with two Blue Jellies. Make
sure you are at full health, then reluctantly continue left...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swim through the calm currents, until the camera zooms out. He's seen you now.
Swim left. Pray to the...

Boss:           Mithalan God
Location:       Mithalas Cathedral
Required Forms: Energy
Attacks:        This Sucks - He reels back, opens that big ol' mouth of his,
                and sucks. You can try to fight the current, but it's strong,
                and if he eats you, you take damage before swimming out again.
                Yuck.
                Energy Blasts - Like nearly every sea creature, the Mithalan
                God has the magical power of Energy Blasts! He fires several
                slow moving blue blasts out of his mouth that home in with a
                wide arc.
                Energy Blasts: Super Pissed Off Edition - Once you damage him
                enough, he'll go bright red and get really mad. Even the
                background music gets mad. Man. Anyway, his Energy Blasts will
                be replaced by their bright red, super fast cousins. Shield
                will no longer deflect these, so just try to avoid them.
                Let There Be Life! - Like all good Gods, this one can create
                life. Unfortunately, he can only seem to create slim mutants.
                Oh well.
                Grabaroo - Once raging, hiding between the poison vents will
                just cause the God to pick you up and eat you. Bad times.
Critical Mode:  He glows red, the music changes, and he starts spamming
                non-deflectable energy blasts. Good luck!
Hints:          If he's so damn hungry, give him something to eat!
                Don't forget, you aren't stuck in Energy Form.
                He's a big guy; he probably won't be interested in your food.
                More likely he'll be interested in you.
                Or at least something the same size as you.
                Maybe something swollen and green and poisonous and gross.
                He needs to be in his kitchen to eat. At the back of his cave.
                How to get him back there? When you shoot him, he goes yellow.
                Remember the last boss that went yellow when you shot him?
                Okay, now he's pissed, and flashes red when I shoot him.
                Red? That's a good colour. Keep doing that.
Guide:          The first boss that really gives people a hard time, and for
                good reason. Naija even suggests exploring elsewhere before
                confronting him! Once you have mastered the controls, however,
                he is not impossible.
                Begin by shooting him back as far as he will go, then switching
                to normal form, binding one of the fatty poison mutants
                hovering around, and drag it towards him. Let it go, then
                return to Energy Form, and open fire. When he is as far back as
                he will go; he will use his Suck attack, and eat the poisonous
                mutant - causing damage.
                This must be repeated three times. If you need more mutants,
                let him walk forward as far as he'll go, and eventually he'll
                create more. Lure them into the poison vents to transform them,
                and repeat. Remember, he'll only create mutants at the front of
                the platform, and only suck at the back of it. Use the shield
                to deflect the energy blasts.
                Once repeated three times, the God's eye will fall out, he'll
                go red, and the music will change. At this point, just switch
                to Energy Form and go nuts. Blasts will damage him, and he'll
                stop using his Suck and Create attacks, replacing them both
                with upgraded Energy Blasts. Dodge the blasts as best you can,
                and don't be afraid to scoff yourself with food halfway through
                the fight. A large supply of healing poultices, along with some
                Veggie Soups for their regeneration, are suggested. Once you
                have blasted his face enough, he'll keel over and die.
                Poor guy.
Rewards:        Beast Form.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright. If that was your first time playing, and you came straight here like
the guide says, and you managed it, well done! Regardless, that's one less God
to deal with, and one extra form.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BEAST FORM | RED - ORANGE - BROWN
              Beast Form allows you to swim against any current, and you can
              attack enemies by sprinting through them. Any enemies killed this
              way will be consumed, and a lot of them will be recycled into
              bullets - Beast Form has ammo limited to what you eat. For
              instance, eating Toads gives you a short supply of their Ricochet
              shots. Eating Moneyee Squid and their nests gives you a supply of
              Moneye Squid to launch. However, the main ability is swimming
              through currents. Beast Form is mapped to number key 3 by
              default.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Head to the back of the cave to find a save point, then take the current up to
appear back in Mithalas City.

Okay, time to backtrack a bit. Either head straight back to Open Waters 2, or,
if you want, read on to backtrack into the Cathedral to pick up another
outfit. If you want to skip ahead, just scroll down a tiny bit to
OPEN WATERS 2. Otherwise, head back right into the cathedral, and read on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/--------------------\
| MITHALAS CATHEDRAL |
\--------------------/
ENEMIES:       Armored Fleas, Rot Worms, Mutant (Slim + Fat), Blue Jellyfish
               Splitters
ITEMS:         
TREASURE:      Mithalan Dress

In the first main room, head up through the current (Beast Form), then head
right. Head down through another current, to find the Mithalan Dress sitting
on a.. bookshelf? Oh well. Head back to Open Waters 2, all the way through
the City and the Ruins.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/---------------\
| OPEN WATERS 2 |
\---------------/
ENEMIES:       Rockhead, Baby Aggrohopper, Tabar, Nautilus, Blaster Peg
               Raspberry, Moneye Squid, Blue Jellyfish, Shrimp, Castle Crab
               Ekritt
ITEMS:         Spicy Roll

So, Naija has a little self-empowerment moment on the way through the Ruins,
then runs into the Mysterious Shadowy Figure again here. Who is that?!?!?
So mysterious. And shadowy. Anyway, go straight left, into the current, and
halfway through swim down through the backcurrent to a little secret cave.
Inside is Ancient Sea Turtle #2. You can now travel quickly between Home
Waters and here! Good going. There is also a Spicy Roll in the song plant at
the back of this room.

Now, head back left, to Open Waters 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/---------------\
| OPEN WATERS 1 |
\---------------/
ENEMIES:       Oarfish, Fish, Raspberry, Moneye Squid, Blue Jellyfish
               Castle Crab, Tabar, Aggrohopper
ITEMS:         

Take the upper path at the split, through the current. Fight past the Tabar
and Aggrohoppers and take the first upper path you can. Keep pushing on, and
soon you'll come to..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------------\
| THE KELP FOREST 1 | #AQWALK010
\-------------------/
ENEMIES:       Spider Crab, Crawpappy, Seahorse, Raspberry, Piranha, Spikyball
               Sea Dragon, Nudibranch, Fish, Leopard Shark
ITEMS:         

Wow, how's that for a change of scenery? One reason I leave this place until
after Mithalas, apart from the added benefits of Beast Form, is that this place
is so upbeat and alive, and you really need that after the grim death haven
that was Mithalas.

Anyway, head up. One thing to note here is the amount of green leaves that can
be Bound for items. Don't forget about them!

On your way up, the first enemy you'll see will probably be the Spider Crab.
Blast or avoid him, then continue on to a large open room, full of new
enemies. I'm not going to guide you through them here, find their names in the
enemy list and check the enemy guide at the end of the walkthrough if you
really need help. But mainly, just blast them all.

One I will note, however, is the Sea Dragon. He's in the minibosses segment,
because he is a lot harder to deal with than the others. Check that out for a
guide, or just run away from them.

At the top, head left. Follow through the tunnel, through the next big room,
to the left wall, where you'll find a save point. After saving, come out and
hug the top wall. Your goal is the long passage leading left, which takes you
to...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------------\
| THE KELP FOREST 2 |
\-------------------/
ENEMIES:       Mosshead, Moneye Squid, Fish, Crawpappy, Crab, Scooter
               Blue Jellyfish, Spikyball, Spider Crab, Seahorse
               Tiny Jellyfish

Head left all the way until you get to a big room. Watch out for Mossheads
lurking in the rocks, but try to take them out if you have the patience. The
goodies they can drop are worth it.

In the large room, head down to the bottom, and take the thin tunnel you find.
Follow it's twists and turns until the end, and in the bottom right you will
find a dark hole leading you to..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/---------------\
| THE FISH CAVE | #AQWALK011
\---------------/
ENEMIES:       Fish

This area is technically entirely optional, but without it the rest of the game
takes a lot longer to do, so I'm not even going to mark it as optional.

Head inside, and the first little cave on the left contains a save point.

Now, this cave is a large puzzle. Each little cave, apart from the one with the
save point, contains a rock with a musical note on it. In the centre of the
cave are a bunch of multicoloured fish. See if you can solve the puzzle
youself.

Give up? Choose one of the notes, go into the middle of the cave, and sing it.
The fish of that colour will flock to you. Move closer to the cave, and sing
again. The fish will follow. Lead all the fish to the rock of their colour -
for instance, the cave above the save point has the musical note of the yellow
colour, two opening leaves. Go to the cave, sing yellow, and the yellow fish
will flock to you. Lead them to that stone, and it'll start glowing.

In case you are blind, the colour of the fish you need to bring to the caves
are, in clockwise order from 12 o'clock, Orange, Purple, Aqua, exit, save
point, Yellow. You don't even need to bring all the fish, 3 of each colour
will do.

Once you have solved the puzzle, Fish Form is yours!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| FISH FORM | GREEN - RED - ORANGE - PURPLE
              Fish Form is the fastest form in the game. Using it makes long
              distance travel a lot easier and less frustrating.
              It also allows Naija to travel through tiny cracks, granting her
              new shortcuts and also access to a lot of new areas.
              Naija also mentions certain enemies will ignore her in Fish Form,
              however I've only really noticed this in one or two enemies.
              The last new ability is Bubbles. Naija's Fish Form can blow tiny
              little bubbles, which can catch a small handful of specific
              creatures inside. This is practically useless in itself, but
              there is a food item that makes these bubbles poisonous for a
              short time - making them a potent weapon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leave Fish Cave and head back to The Kelp Forest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------------\
| THE KELP FOREST 2 |
\-------------------/
ENEMIES:       Mosshead, Moneye Squid, Fish, Crawpappy, Crab, Scooter
               Blue Jellyfish, Spikyball, Spider Crab, Seahorse
               Tiny Jellyfish, Bigmaul

Head up and around the little loop, and you'll see a tiny crack - in Fish Form,
Naija can swim through these. You may have noticed one or two on your journey
already, and now you know what they are for! I will be referring to them as
Fish Tunnels for the purpose of this guide.

Head up out of the large room the way you originally came, but then take the
path up all the way to Kelp Forest 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------------\
| THE KELP FOREST 3 |
\-------------------/
ENEMIES:       Shrimp, Wisker, Spikyball, Pistol Shrimp, Piranha, Spider Crab
               Orbiter, Sea Dragon, Shrimp, Tiger Shark, Leopard Shark
               Mermog, Seawolf, Seahorse, Crawpappy, Bigmouth, Krill
               Blue Jellyfish
ITEMS:         Sea Cake, Spicy Roll, Leecing Poultice, Hand Roll
TREASURE:      Jelly Egg

Head all the way to the left after you come in, watching out for the spines the
Wisker launch. At the end there's a song plant containing a Sea Cake being
guarded by a Pistol Shrimp.

Make a beeline north, through the Spider Crab cave, and continue north past the
first split. At the top, head right through the current, then head down and
right.

At the bottom you'll find a fish tunnel leading to a save point on your left,
then head back right and up. Allow the impassable vines to shape your course
through the currents, and pass by another Sea Dragon (note: the Sea Dragon is
one of the few monsters that does ignore you in Fish Form, happy times!).

Pass by the stationary Nudibranches. These are the solid spiky multicoloured
things that bar your path. They can actually be drawn away by song of the
appropriate colour, do so if you cannot fit through the gaps. Make sure to
grab the Spicy Roll from the bottom of the small Wisker-filled room before
you continue left.

In this large and current/Nudibranch filled room, you need to squeeze your
way up the middle. On the top of the large platform in the upper left, there's
a song plant containing a Leeching Poultice.

Head right through the next few rooms, being careful of the sharks, Mermog
and Piranha. When you finally do reach the far right wall, switch to Beast
Form and grab the Jelly Egg treasure in the bottom right.

Allow the current to take you up, then head left to new map and a save point.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue past the save point for a Hand Roll in a song plant, then go back and
save. Head up the long ominous coridoor as the music dies, and get ready to
rumble with the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Drunian God
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Required Forms: Energy
Attacks:        Seeds! - The Drunian God can spawn multiple Spikyballs from her
                face, which then proceed to bounce around the room, swept
                around by the currents. These disappear on their own if you
                wait a little while.
                Worms! - She calls forth spiky one-eyed worms from the walls.
                These proceed to circle you. Shoot them in the eye multiple
                times to deal with them. After a few moments, however, they
                disappear on their own.
                Shock! - When you sing to her, she gets so surprised that a
                circle of energy blasts shoot out of her face. Just position
                yourself far enough away that you can avoid these.
Critical Mode:  The goes red, opens her eyes continuously, and 3 large 
                Spikyballs circle her, acting as a shield. She also continually
                summons un-Shield-able energy blasts and worms. Keep firing!!
Hints:          Looks like she's really just a big face. Probably have to
                damage that, then.
                Attacks don't seem to work! Just relax.
                She's not the only one that can sing.
                She looks surprised! Now's your chance!
                Like all bosses in every game, rinse and repeat.
                Uh-oh, now she's pissed. End the fight quickly!
Guide:          Not too hard, nothing compared to the Mithalan God, anyway.
                Start by dodging her Seeds! and Worms! attack. When she sings
                a single note, sing it back to her. She'll use Shock!, but you
                can even deflect a shot or two back at her with Shield if you
                are good. Once her eyes are open, blast her with Energy Form
                until she closes them again. Rinse and repeat this part several
                times, she'll summon more Spikyballs and Worms each time,
                however.
                Eventually she will go red, at this point stay in Energy Form
                and blast her to your hearts content, avoiding the multiple
                high-powered energy blasts and worms she summons. Several
                hundred energy blasts later, she's toast!
Reward:         Nature Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sweet, another new form. Feel bad for the poor Drunia, though. The more I hear
about this Creator the less I like him.

Anyway, Nature Form.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| NATURE FORM | ORANGE - GREEN - PURPLE
              Nature Form is pretty specialist, having only a few very specific
              uses. The right click move launches a seed, which sprouts into
              a few flowers on impact. This does no damage to enemies, but can
              be used for two things: 1) They open those blue bulbs you may
              have seen laying around, allowing you to travel between them, and
              2) They allow you to open those large red flower bulbs. Charging
              up the right click before releasing causes the seed to sprout
              into a large thorn, which can damage enemies, and launch Naija
              if positioned correctly.
              Nature Form can also pass through a few natural boundaries, like
              anemones, without harm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, head back down to the save point, then left, and use Nature Form's attack
on the bulb there. Head through to find yourself back in THE KELP FOREST 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swim left and up a bit, and the Mysterious Shadowy Stranger will say hi again.
So. Damn. Mysterious. I dunno about you guys, but it sends chills down my
spine.

Anyway, head left and up some more to find another Ancient Sea Turtle! Huzzah!
Head back left and up, past the Bigmaul and her babies to return to
THE KELP FOREST 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head up and right, past the creepy Seawolf in his cave, and then continue on to
come across several red plant bulbs. Now, there's a small optional thing to do
here, which results in the second Verse Egg. If you wish to skip it, continue
right, through the tunnel to THE KELP FOREST 4. Then scroll down and pick up
the walkthrough from there. Otherwise, read on.

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Verse Egg, 2 Red Bulbs

Use Nature Form's attack on one of the bulbs, then Bind the pearl that comes
out. Drag it up and right, hugging the right wall through the cave. Follow the
wall up and right, and slot the pearl into the holder. Light it up with some
energy and go through the now opened door.

Go up and keep left, watching out or defeating the large Bigmouth fish,
together with his vacuum parasitic tongue. Gross. Keep left and you'll find
a fish tunnel at the end of a short cave. At the end of this tiny tunnel is
the Verse Egg! Also a song plant with two Red Bulbs is to the up and left,
past the vines that look impassable! Sneaky things.

Head all the way back to the red bulbs where you got the Pearl. Head right,
through the tunnel, to come to..

ENEMIES:       Pistol Shrimp, Spikyball, Mermog, Seawolf, Wisker, Piranha
               Spikyball, Mosshead, Blaster Peg, Sea Dragon, Tiger Shark
ITEMS:         Healing Poultice, Shark Fin Soup, Veggie Cake

Another part of The Kelp Forest. Head right, watching out for the Pistol Shrimp
and head up. Grab the Healing Poultice from the song plant on the roof, then
head right. Deal with the Tiger Shark, then sing some of those stationary
Nudibranch out of the way so you can get to the Shark Fin Soup song plant.

Head all the way up this passage, watching out for the Wisker and Piranha near
the top. Head right into the huge room, and grab the 2 red bulbs from the song
plant guarded by Blaster Pegs at the top. Then swim down and left, and grab
the Veggie Cake guarded by the Mosshead in the little cave to the left.

Okay, a bunch of optional stuff is coming up now. If you don't wish to do any
of this, head straight down, through the current, and down into THE KELP
FORST 1. Scroll down a bit, and pick up the guide from there. Otherwise, read
on!

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Leeching Poultice, Veggie Soup, Spider Roll, Swamp Cake,
                Baby Piranha Egg

Swim almost exactly right to find the entrance to the Forest Sprite Cave, built
into the wall of the giant rock there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/--------------------\
| FOREST SPRITE CAVE |
\--------------------/
ITEMS:         Leeching Poultice, Veggie Soup
TREASURE:      Seed Bag

Swim into the main room to find a save point at the bottom. The Forest Nymphs
here are harmless, and seem quite happy that you have the Nature Form. Head
through the fish tunnel north of the save point to grab the Leeching Poultice,
then head back out and to the upper right.

Use Nature Form on the blue bulb there to transport to a hidden area. Grab the
Veggie Soup from the song plant to the right, then head down and left and
follow the path all the way around to find the Seed Bag treasure. Then
backtrack and leave the Forest Sprite Cave.

               Orbiter, Bigmaul, Tiger Shark, Tiny Jellyfish, Blue Jellyfish
               Electric Jellyfish, Electric Eel, Mermog
ITEMS:         Spider Roll, Swamp Cake, Leeching Poultice

Head up and right, out of this huge room, and head up at the split. You'll
find yourself in a dark cave with Mermog, and before long you'll need to use
a fish tunnel to proceed any further.

To the left inside the Mermog Cave you'll find a Swamp Cake, then proceed
right into the Mermog Cave proper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside, kill all the Mermog you see as you proceed, to make sure they are no
hassle in a few minutes. Grab the Leeching Poultice from the dark area to the
top left, then swim through the currents to the right. Naija will, for some
reason, chuckle, and you'll have to do the dance of death with...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mergog
Location:       Mermog Cave
Attacks:        Super Blasts - Mergog will sit in his little cubbyhole in the
                far right of the cave, and launch a seemingly endless barrage
                of blasts at you. They do not corner well, use this to your
                advantage and sit in one of the little dips near the vines to
                the south.
                Chargin' Mah.. you get it - Mergog charges a laser, then fires
                it while moving around. Stay really low to the ground to avoid
                this, as he cannot fire it that low.
Critical Mode:  None, as far as I'm aware.
Hints:          His attacks may look scary, but they are easy to dodge.
                Just keep shooting!
Guide:          Not hard at all, very possible to do it without even getting
                hit. If you just sit in a little area between two vines on the
                bottom floor and keep spamming energy blasts, he'll be dead in
                no time at all, and both his attacks will miss you completely.
                He may ram you, so be careful of that, but even that is very
                unlikely.
Rewards:        Piranha Egg
                Special Bulb
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make totally sure to grab the Special Bulb from behind Mergog when you win. And
remember to stick around until the egg hatches if you want the pet.

After that bit of excitement, leave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in The Kelp Forest, backtrack to the split and head south, fighting off
Electric Jellyfish and Eels on the way. Head right at the bottom, and grab the
Spider Roll hiding in a song plant behind a rock. Make use of the Blue Jellies
too! Then head all the way left, then down back to The Kelp Forest 1.

               Blaster Peg
ITEMS:         
TREASURE:      Odd Container

Okay, we're gonna cheat a little bit here. Head into the main area, fighting
the Bigmaul away. To the upper right, you'll find a small dark cave. Inside
this cave, there is a fake ceiling. If you swim through this fake ceiling,
then swim right and down into the black, you'll find the Odd Container
treasure.

You are not supposed to do this until you have a later form, but to save on
backtracking it's very possible to do it now.

Once you've grabbed that, leave the same way you came in, then head down in
the main area. There's nothing else to grab here, so save at the save point
and then head all the way to the right, then down and right to a new area.

ENEMIES:       Horseshoe Crab, Crab, Flatfish, Hydraworm
ITEMS:         Verse Egg

Yep, I bet you thought you were done with Open Waters. Not quite.

First thing to grab is another Verse Egg. It's so easy to get, I'm not even
going to class it as optional. Head up, sticking to the ceiling, until you
find a fish tunnel. Watch out for the Horseshoe Crabs on the way, they can be
a pain.

Squeeze through the tunnel, being wary of the crab that also likes to use it,
then follow the next tunnel all the way. Fight the Flatfish and the Hydraworm
at the end, and grab the Verse Egg! Easy. Head all the way back to where
you entered this zone from.

This time head right, following the path, fighting Horseshoe Crabs as you go.
Loot the Swamp Cake from the song plant on the left wall, then continue on.

The path to the left is blocked by steam vents by the look of it, so take the
path that leads down to get back to...

ITEMS:         Crab Cake

You're in a previously unexplored area of Open Waters 2. Follow the path,
grabbing the Crab Cake recipe from the song plant in the large Globe Crab
filled room you come to, while deftly dealing with the Squiddy. Head down,
past about 40,007 more Globe Crabs, to enter the part of Open Waters 2 that
should look familiar.

Head right through the current, then up all the way past the Swordfish to
enable a short cutscene. We aren't scared of boiling hot balls of death!

Continue upwards.

TREASURE:      Stone Head

We're now on the other side of those steam vents, woo. Hang a left as you swim
up, though, past more Horseshoe Crabs and a Lionfish. Yes, I'm aware here the
game calls this are The Veil, but the map still says Open Waters, so.

Continue up on the left tunnel, but keep right as you do so. Swim right when
the terrain allows, to find the Stone Head treasure sitting in a little dip.

After doing so, continue all the way up via whichever path you choose, going
up, and up, and up, until you reach...

               Electric Jellyfish, Shrimp
ITEMS:         Long Life Soup

The map now says The Veil, so as do I. Swim up, following the tunnel. Use the
fish tunnel to your right as you swim up to find the Long Life Soup recipe,
but then come back out the way you came. Continue heading up, through all the
tunnels, through the Starmie caves and past the puffer fish, up and up, until
you finally... break the surface. Naija remarks on the feeling, and I admit
I was pretty "whoah" when I first did this part.

Using Beast Form, practice breaking through The Veil, as Naija puts it, a
few times. When you learn the physics, leap over the rock to your left,
admiring the cute monkeys, to find an Ancient Sea Turtle in a little pool.
Awesome. There's also a save point to the left.

Okay, we're gonna do a little optional stuff now, pick up a few items and
a few treasures. Skip ahead to where we return to The Veil if you do not
wish to get them.

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Urchin Armor, Turtle Egg, Leaf Poultice

Swim down then left into Turtle Cave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-------------\
| TURTLE CAVE |
\-------------/
ENEMIES:       Turtle, Crab, Scooter, Fish, Monkey, Metaray, Ruhk
ITEMS:         Leaf Poultice
TREASURE:      Turtle Egg, Urchin Armor

Follow the tunnel, ignoring the super cute turtles, and go up at the split.
Then hang a left, and keep going until you find a pile of rocks blocking up a
tunnel on the ground. Bind them out of the way to find the Turtle Egg treasure
at the back of the tunnel.

Go back out, and head right a bit. On the surface you'll find a waterfall. Use
Beast Form to travel up it, then hop through the cave and up another waterfall.
Keep travelling this way, then start using bubbles instead. You travel through
bubbles exactly the same way as you do the water.

On the right of this area, in a bubble, is a song plant containing three Leaf
Poultices. At the top of this area is a giant bubble, and if you sprint, in
Beast Form, out of that, you'll find an even higher bubble containing an item!
The only way to reach this is to use a Speed + item, such as Veggie Soup, then
quickly making the jump while the effect is active. Do so to find the item
is the Urchin Armor!

For an extra super secret, if you speed launch yourself diagonally up and right
of this bubble, you'll find a super rare Ruhk nest! This nest contains,
surprisingly, a Ruhk. If you shoot the Ruhk it'll fly away leaving you an
Egg, a very rare ingredient. It is, however, insanely difficult to get to the
nest, so I do not blame you if you skip it.

Just as a note, there's a giant momma turtle to the very left of the cave.
You can't do anything with her, and she just screams at you if you try. Oh
well.

Leave the cave the same way you came in, and head to the save point.

               Krill, Super Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish
ITEMS:         Hot Soup, Spicy Soup

Alrighty, head back right to the main area of The Veil. You need to get to
the right side of The Veil now, so either use your elite jumping skills to
scale the rock in the middle, or use the underground currents. Either way,
aimlessly swim around the expanse of the right side of The Veil for a while,
and eventually you'll find a weird be-flippered one-eyed thing swimming around.
The camera will focus on it, so don't worry about missing it. When you do find
it, swim close to it, and it'll flee. Follow it inside the cave. Make sure he
swims into the cave and disappears before you enter, or it won't count.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside the cave, save and then continue tracking the weird creature. Corner it
at the back of the cave, and Naija will take over. She suggests removing his
shell. Good idea! Use Bind.

Cutscene.

After Naija finishes worrying if she looks fat, you learn Li's Song.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| LI SONG | RED - GREEN - AQUA
              Singing the Li Song will call Li close to you, if he is not on
              the screen when you sing it. If he is, it will enable or disable
              his attack mode. Useful if you are trying not to attract unwanted
              attention, or if you want him to back you up in a fight!
              Note that Li cannot keep up with Fish or Beast Forms very well,
              but on a map change he will catch up regardless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that shocking revelation is over, Li will follow you wherever you go. If
you want him to remain, right click his helmet in the back of the cave, but
there is no reason to not have him around.

Above the area you regain control is a cooking spot. Jump out of the water to
Li's tent to activate it. If you've been neglecting cooking, now would be a
good time to catch up. Leave Li's Cave when you are done.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you head to the little outcrop above Li's Cave, you'll find a rock covering
a song plant containing 2 Hot Soups. Now it's time to head down through the
twisty turny tunnels, all the way to the bottom. If you've been following my
guide, this will be the first time you meet the Super Raspberry - well, apart
from in that nightmare at the start of the game. These guys suck, basically.
Their shots home in well, and can cover great distances before dissapapting.
Take them down asap.

At the very bottom of the area, you'll find a rock hiding a passage with a
Spicy Soup in it. After nabbing it, leave the passage and head right to...

ENEMIES:       Flatfish, Seahorse, Fish, Swordfish, Lionfish, Starmie, 
               Hydraworm, Globe Crab, Blaster Peg, Leopard Shark
               Great White
ITEMS:         
TREASURE:      Golden Starfish

Head right, past what we can only assume is Li's odd submarine, aaaaaaall the
way to the bottom right area. Grab the Golden Starfish treasure, then head up.

At the top, there's a little optional area for a couple of items, but if you
don't wish to grab them, head left into the Sun Temple and pick the guide up
a few lines below. If you want the items, read on.

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Shark Fin Soup, Ruhk Egg

Head right through that little tunnel in the right wall. Switch to Beast Form,
and charge through the darkness. There's a current in there, and the tunnel
loops to the right. It's not long or too hard to get through even if you can't
see.

On the other side, you'll come to a long chute that goes up, and then the
water ends. What you need to do here is wall jump. When Naija sticks to a
veritcal wall out of water, she'll cling to it for half a second before
falling off. In this half a second, you can aim and perform another jump, 
which will then give you another half-second when she lands to perform
another, and so forth. In this fashion, you can climb veritcal tunnels
such as this. Search YouTube if you are still confused.

Just a note, I find it a lot, a lot easier to do this with the mouse and
keyboard combo. Aim where you want Naija to jump, then hit space. Move
the mouse to the new spot, and hit space again. It makes it a lot easier.

Half way up the chute you'll find a passage to the left with a song plant
containing Shark Fin Soup. At the very very top, you'll find a Ruhk Nest.
Shoot the Ruhk a few times, grab the Egg, then jump to the left to plummet
back down into the ocean.

Swim left into The Sun Temple.

| THE SUN TEMPLE | #AQWALK013
\----------------/
ENEMIES:       Clockwork Fish, Clockwork Crab, Snail Gear, Skeeter
ITEMS:         Royal Soup, Hearty Soup, Special Cake
TREASURE:      The Sun Key

Time for a good ol' dungeon, The Sun Temple. What will we find??!?!?? Let's
see. Swim left, through the two rooms then up. Acquaint yourself with the
Clockwork Fish and Snail Gear, then head right.

Keep following the path until you come across a song plant under glass. Use
Energy Form to blast the glass, then sing to release 2 Glowing Eggs. In the
next room, swim left to find a save point. Beward of the Clockwork Crab, The
Sun Temple's most annoying enemy.

Head up to the top of the water to find a gear. Spin next to the gear for a
few seconds, and the water level will rise! Head right one room to find a
song plant with 4 plant leaves.

If you then hug the right wall, near the top of this room is a secret passage.
Within is the Sun Key treasure, and also the Royal Soup recipe. The Sun Key
is easy enough to see, however the song plant containing the Royal Soup is
hidden in the pitch black area of the darkness. At this point the only way to
get it is to sing each note for 4-5 seconds until you hear it pop, then smash
the glass holding it and swim around the floor until you pick it up.

Back in the main room, head up the newly-wet passageway to find a crystal in
a little boat. Bind it, pull it over the passageway you just swam up, then
swim back to the gear in the main room and spin again, lowering the water
level. Hop back over the now-dry island to your right using Beast Form, to
find the boat has been lowered through the passageway!

Bind it again, drag it against the left wall, then go spin the gear.. again.
The water will raise the boat into a new room, so swim up there. Bind it
again, drag it over the vertical passageway in the middle of the room, then..
You guessed it, swim down, spin the gear, wait for the boat to come down.

Drag it over to your left, over the bubbles, and.. spin the gear.. again.
Sheesh. Follow it up the new passageway, bind it and drag it left into the
light.

The crystal will power up, and apparently get too heavy for the boat, which
tips it out. Why couldn't it have done that earlier?! Bind the now loose
crystal, and swim back down into the gear room.

Still dragging the crystal, drag it down into the dark room below. The crystal
is now giving off light, so you can see even in the darkness. Now you see
why we did that puzzle just now! Drag it to the left side of this darkned
room to see a door.

It will silently show musical notes. You must copy these correctly, 5 or 6 in
a row, to unlock the door. Be aware of the Clockwork Crab in this room while
you do this. Swim left, then all the way up the next darkened room. At the
very top you'll find an encased song plant with a Hearty Soup in it.

Swim back down part way, then hang a left, through two rooms, then up. In
the next big room, you need to make a choice. One path holds a treasure,
2 recipes and a memory, the other way just leads to the boss. To get to the
boss, take a right, follow the path, spin the gear in the room to the left to
raise the water, then carry on. Hit the save point to the left, then head right
into the cave. Then skip down to the next row of dashes. For the optional
stuff, read on:

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Gear, Leadership Roll, Turtle Soup, Memory #2

You may have noticed the robotic invincible lobsters that come into this room.
They come from a little duct on the left. Swim into this duct, and follow the
path around to come across a secret room containing the Gear treasure.

Continue on the hidden path, into the next room. Spin the gear to raise the
water, then take the upper left route. The water will stop part way, so
use your amazing walljumping skill to leapfrog your way into the next room.

If you didn't walljump before, search up for the optional Ruhk Egg in The
Veil 2, it will explain.

In the next room, dry jump to the bottom right corner for a Leadership Roll.
Beward the Clockwork Crab in this area. You then need to jump from gear to
gear, then from gear to ceiling to gear, to get to the upper right corner.
Sounds hard, and can be, but you soon learn how to do it. It's the same
as walljumping. Note that if she is tilted at 89 degrees or less than
horizontal, she will cling on indefinitely. Use that to your advantage when
landing on gears.

In the next room, your goal is the opening in the ceiling. Note there is
a Turtle Soup in the bottom right corner, though. If you fall through the
gap in the middle of the room, refer to your map for how to get back.

This can be one of the most frustrating areas of the game, so do not worry
if you get annoyed. Just keep trying and you'll eventually make it to that
gap. Swim up through it when you do.

In this new area, walljump your way up the glass pipe to the huge bubble
at the top. Swim into the middle to unlock another of Naija's Memories.

Huh, you really woulda thought Li could have told Naija that one. Oh well.
Swim back down into the temple, then fall through that gap in the room
you probably fell through hundreds of times already. Hit the save point
to the left, then swim right to enter a creepy cave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, this creepy cave is full of creepy spiky balls, that hurt like the
dickens to touch. The water level also fluctuates consistently, so learn the
timing as you swim.

Head right, over a wall of spiky balls, and blow open the song plant for 3
plant leaves, if you can manage it.

Now, if you look at your map, you will see two long tunnels above the next
area. Yep, you guessed right, they both hold a hard to find item. I'll tell you
now, one is a Special Cake, the other a Special Bulb. Getting up there is, for
lack of a word, a pain. You need a speed + item, really good aim, and a lot of
patience. Obviously only attempt it when the water is high. If you manage it,
kudos. If not, come back for them later. There's also a turtle soup in the
area between these two tunnels.

Continue on your merry way, through the tunnels laced with deadly spikes, to
come face to face with the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Sun God
Location:       The Sun Temple
Required Forms: Energy, Beast, Nature
Attacks:        This both Sucks, and Blows - The Sun God can change the level
                of the water in his chamber at will, and while doing so will
                either try to bite you himself, or blow you into one of the
                dangerous spiky balls in the room. If positioned correctly, he
                can even blow you out of the broken window in the ceiling,
                forcing you to climb back through the entire temple to try
                again.
                Chew - The Sun God is constantly chewing, if you get bit it
                hurts. A lot.
Critical Mode:  The Sun God moves around faster, and fires off a constant
                stream of energy blasts.
Hints:          Simplest boss in the game, really. Maybe if you shoot him???
Guide:          Just because it's simple doesn't mean it's easy. This boss will
                require lots of quick thinking and health items, so bring a
                plentiful supply of both. At the start, you only have to deal
                with the Sun God's ability to change the water depth - sucking
                it in, which can cause damage if you touch him, and blowing it
                out, which can cause damage if you touch a spiky ball. Also
                worth noting: if you get blown or jump out of the ceiling, you
                will fall to The Veil and have to climb all the way back up to
                re-attempt this boss.
                Once you get him damaged, he'll go Critical, and start firing
                energy at you. Basically continue the same routine, avoiding
                everything at all costs, and chomping on poultices and cakes
                whenever you need to. There's not much strategy to this
                boss - just evade, stick to the walls whenever you can, and
                keep shooting him. Bringing some Energy Shot + food wouldn't
                go amiss, either. Good luck.
Rewards:        Sun Form

Boy, wasn't that fun?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SUN FORM | GREEN - RED - GREEN - RED
              In Sun Form, Naija constantly gives off a large circle of light,
              more than enough to light up dark areas on its own. She also
              propels a shaft of light in the direction she is swimming.
              Her right-click charge ability blasts the whole screen with
              light, which fades over several seconds. This makes navigating
              dark areas a breeze!
              Unfortunately, she is defenseless in this form, which means
              changing forms a lot in hostile, dark areas.              
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh yeah, one note before we leave, the water level is now fixed very high.
Those two goodies at the top of the tunnels in the previous room are now very
easy to reach. Why didn't I tell you this sooner? I managed to get both the
hard way, and if I have to suffer, EVERYONE HAS TO SUFFER.

Anyway, after getting Sun Form, leap out of the shattered window in the now-ex
Sun God's room.

| THE VEIL 2 |
\------------/
ENEMIES:       Flatfish, Seahorse, Fish, Swordfish, Lionfish, Starmie, 
               Hydraworm, Globe Crab, Blaster Peg, Leopard Shark
               Great White
ITEMS:         

Yep, you'll be thrown back into The Veil, on the other side of the temple. 

There's an Ancient Sea Turtle directly below you! Score! There's also a save
point in a cave directly to your left, over a little island. Once saved, head
back to the Sea Turtle.

Okay, you now have the ability to gain a new pet, which we'll do now. It's
optional, as all pets, so if you don't want it, take the Sea Turtle back to
Open Waters and skip ahead to OPEN WATERS 2.

Otherwise, read on!

OPTIONAL ITEMS: Legendary Cake, Sight Poultice

First, take a look at the map. See that weird opening above you? Looks kind of
like a mouth on a face? Eat a speed boosting item and Beast Form lunge up
there as best you can. At the top, swim up a waterfall and bust the song
plant for the Legendary Cake! Jump back down and swim down to the bottom of
this little area. In fish form, swim through the tunnel to your right.

Take this all the way to the bottom, ignoring the split, and through the map
change to find a Sight Poultice at the end. Then, go back, and this time,
take the split to the left.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this cave, swim onwards and switch to Energy Form. In the big room you are
ambushed by two kinds of Nautilus, some Squiddy and even an Octopus! Once you
have dealth with them all, Beast Form through the current, then Sun Form
charge to reveal you're in a room full of spikes and Electric Jellyfish! Pile
through them to the bottom, and in the next room you'll face the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Octopus Prime
Location:       Octopus Cave (The Veil)
Attacks:        Overcompensation - The Octopus vomits 3 huge homing energy
                blasts, however they do not corner well, and if you sit in the
                area above the Octopus they will all miss you.
                Abomination - The Octopus will spawn a regular squid. Surely
                that shouldn't happen!
                Excess Ink - The Octopus will shoot ink, darkening the entire
                arena.
                Grab - When you get too close to the beak, the Octopus will
                swing it's arm down in an attempt to grab you.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          I'm not doing any damage! I need a weak spot.
                I can't see! How did I manage to see in the cave on the way
                here?
                Just before he tries to grab me, something shows up, just
                for a second..
Guide:          Not too bad once you get the pattern down. To start with, wait
                above him (but not too close) until he's just done an energy
                blast attack, then swim down in front of his face. This'll
                cause an audio cue, along with him reaching his arm back to
                swing, and his weak point, a pink orb, showing in his beak.
                Shoot this orb while swimming backwards out of the range of the
                arm. You can only get in two or three shots per time, but if
                you can repeat it quickly enough, he will very rarely use any
                other attacks.
                Obviously, switch to Sun Form and charge a right click blast
                when he uses his ink attack,  and shoot down any squid he
                spawns.
                Continue blasting his weak point, healing when necessary,
                to finish him off.
Reward:         Dumbo Octopus Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the third pet is yours, head all the way back out of the cave. Go back and
save, then take the Sea Turtle to Open Waters.

               Ekritt, Puffer Fish, Lionfish, Globe Crab, Squiddy

Alright. We're going to do something now that is technically optional, but I'm
not going to list it as such because it's a pain if you don't do it. Head
east, back into Mithalas City (Ruins).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-----------------------\
| MITHALAS CITY (RUINS) |
\-----------------------/
ENEMIES:       Toad, Moray Eel, Splitter, Fish, Huggy, Dark Jellyfish, Seahorse
               Armored Flea
ITEMS:         Tasty Roll
TREASURE:      Mithala Doll, Mithalas Pot

Head to the first split. If you stick to the right wall as you go up, you'll
find an open house we didn't enter. Go inside, and through the fish tunnel to
find the Mithala Doll and the Tasty Roll recipe (inside a pot).

Head to the top of the area now, and then right through the strong current.
Follow the path in this new area, and at the bottom of the first corner you'll
find a pot that's coloured differently from the others - this is actually the
Mithalas Pot treasure.

Continue on to find a song plant full of 8.. rotten loaves. Woo. In the next
large room you'll find some plant leaves in a song plant on the left wall,
and a save point at the bottom. Save then use Nature Form to open the
blue bulb to your right, grabbing the 3 little bones in the song plant there
beforehand.

In the new area of Mithalas City, go through the current. Swim in front of the
large window within to fight the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mithalan Priests
Location:       Mithalas Cathedral
Required Forms: Energy, Nature, Beast
Attacks:        Goin' Incorporeal - When not attacking, these guy's enter the
                spirit world where you cannot attack them.
                Energy Blasts - More often than not, however, they become solid
                so they can fire streams of homing energy blasts at you.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          Not much to this boss, really. Circle and fire, circle
                and fire.
Guide:          So once you enter the middle of this room, the three Spirit
                Priests will appear and begin circling you. Switch to
                Energy Form.
                Don't bother locking on, just swim around in circles and hammer
                the right mouse button! Your shots only count when the Priests
                are corporeal, but as this is impossible to predict it's safer
                to fire blasts non-stop.
                When the Priests attack, the room will pretty quickly fill with
                energy blasts. It isn't easy to avoid these, but you can corner
                faster than the blasts can so if you are swimming in circles
                away from them it isn't too hard.
                Sooner or later one priest will go down, at which point the
                fight is even easier. Just keep right clicking and pretty soon
                the other two will subside too.
Rewards:        Spirit Form.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you have Spirit Form. This is the final optional form, and is arguably
the least useful, but oh well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SPIRIT FORM | RED - PURPLE - BLUE
              Spirit Form turns you into just that, a spirit. The world stops,
              and you can even see Naija's body frozen in time. The spirit
              can only move a certain distance away from Naija before
              automatically transporting back. The Spirit Form's main use is
              passing steam currents, through use of the handy blue gems
              always located nearby. Turning into a spirit, then swimming past
              the vents, approaching the blue gem, and right clicking, will
              transport Naija's solid body through the vent and to the gem.
              The second, nearly unknwon use, is the right click can also
              disperse any energy blasts incoming to you. This makes some boss
              fights a lot easier, but it's not really needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use your new form below, use the spirit to pass the steam to the left, then
right click the blue crystal to pull Naija through. Pick up the treasure
Drask's Trident, then teleport back the same way, leaving the way you came in.

Leave the ruins altogether, back to Open Waters 2.

Right. Now you have that form, every area in the game is open to you. You can
proceed to the final areas now, if you wish, but I am going to go through all
the optional areas and get all the missed treasures now. If you wish to skip
all of this, and I don't recommend that, head to the bottom of Open Waters 2
to enter Open Waters 4, then all the way through that to reach The Abyss 1.
Search for #AQWALK014 to proceed.

OPTIONAL ITEMS:     Blaster Peg Egg, Divine Soup, Spider Roll, Tasty Roll
                    Third Cooking Slot, Perogi
OPTIONAL TREASURES: Anemone Seed, Energy Idol, Black Peal, Walker Baby
                    Song Plant Spore, Arnassi Statue, Crab Armour
                    Arnassi Armor, King's Skull

For those of you who want awesome secret items, hitch a ride on the Sea Turtle
back to Home Waters!

| HOME WATERS |

ENEMIES:       Crotoid, Shrimp, Raspberry, Tiny Jellyfish, Fish, Eel, Seahorse,
               Tromulo, Grouper, Octopus, Scooter, Raspberry, Octopus,
               Aggrohopper

Head south east to Song Cave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head to the bottom left of this area, left of the save point. Remember the
giant ceiling aneomone? Switch to Nature Form and swim up through it. Yes, it's
possible. You'll have to swim through a current, so keep sprinting to make it.
At the top of the tunnel you'll find the Anemone Seed treasure.

Head back out, and into the Energy Temple.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Past the save point, you'll see a fish tunnel on the floor below. Take it to
find the Energy Idol treasure. Then head back out of the fish tunnel and head
right. Beast Form charge through the current below you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, use Nature Form's seed to open the red plant, then bind the pearl and 
swim down the passage. In the small offshoot to the north, just after the
little energy light bulb thing, place the pearl into the pedestal and light it.
Go inside, fighting the Blaster Pegs, until you find the...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Blaster Peg Prime
Location:       Energy Temple - Secret Room
Attacks:        Blast - The Blaster Peg will roam around the room, and when
                close will fire many many blaster shots at you. Just dodge
                them.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          If only you had something to shoot him with.. oh, wait.
Guide:          As you enter the room, proceed slowly, and shoot any little
                Blaster Pegs you find. When you get far enough into the room,
                the door will close, a laugh will sound and the Prime will
                attack. 
                Pretty straightforward boss, just keep shooting him until he
                croaks. Use some healing items, or some Energy Shot + items,
                if you want.
Reward:         Blaster Peg Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hooray, now you have the, in my opinion, best pet in the game. Head back out of
The Energy Temple the way you just came in, then swim right to Open Waters 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head right, past the save point, past the Mithalan Statue, all the way to the
split. Head up, then as far left as you can go, to some creepy creepy faces.

Through the fish crack in the ceiling above, you'll find the odd and
frustrating Hardbeetle. This guy is the only source of the Diving Soup in the
game, but he takes about 3-6 minutes of energy blasts to the face before he
coughs it up. Either smash him down, or just read the Recipes section for
the ingredients you need to create it yourself.

Anywho, once done, head up to The Kelp Forest 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----==SUPER SUPER OPTIONAL==----
Head right to Open Waters 5. That area with the steam? Head there, use Spirit
Form to go halfway through, grab the Special Bulb. Then come back.
--==END SUPER SUPER OPTIONAL==--

Head up to The Kelp Forest 4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head to the very top left, and check out that little side passage, with the
Seawolf in it. Behind him is a long and dark vine filled passage, that leasds
to the Black Pearl treasure. Use Sun Form to get there and back safely.

Head down and left to The Kelp Forest 3, then left and down to The Kelp
Forest 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go down past two splits, then head right, while hugging the floor. When you
get to the Mosshead, use Sun Form to reveal a hidden passage underneath him.

Follow this path 50 miles below the surface to find the Walker cave! Grab the
Spider Roll from the song plant to the left, then head further down. Use Spirit
Form to pass the Walker down there to nab the Walker Baby treasure. Then head
all the way back up. Woo.

Head up to the top level, and ride the Sea Turtle back to Open Waters 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head down to Open Waters 4.

Head down into the main chamber, then head right through the current. Destroy
the Moneye Squid there, then squeeze through the fish tunnel in the statue's
mouth. Use Sun Form inside, to find the Whale Song! Note it down for later.

Swim back out, and down, then right again at the next current. Head up at the
next current, grab the Special Bulb from the song plant on the left. Then head
right, and up again - grab the Song Plant Spore treasure from the left side of
this upper room.

Head back down and follow the room right and down, grabbing the Tasty Roll from
below. Head left and down a current, then right and down another, then right to

ENEMIES:       Seahorse, Deep Shrimp

Breeze past the save point, then head down. At the bottom left of the largest
area, you'll find a secret cave if you use Sun Form. Inside is the Arnassi
Statue treasure. Then head right. You'll see, on the map, a fish tunnel. Track
it down and take it to come to a big open cave, full of nothing but.. a Sea
Turtle. Take it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, turns out it's not a normal Sea Turtle. This one takes you to one place
only - a secret cave in The Kelp Forest! Swim up and left to find, some say,
the hardest boss in Aquaria..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Simon Says
Location:       Arnassi Ruins
Attacks:        Simon Says - Read the guide.
Hints:          No hints here, I'm afraid!
Guide:          I hope you know what Simon Says is. Basically, this weird
                creature has one large eye in the centre, and 8 small orbs
                around it, one for each note you can sing. When you right click
                him, the "fight" begins. He'll sing a note by blinking one of
                the coloured orbs. You need to repeat said note, quickly.
                He'll then repeat the first note, and add a second. You need
                to then play these two notes. He and you will then take turns,
                up until he is singing 8 notes in a row. Get one wrong, or
                take too long, and he will roar and you'll need to right click
                him to start all over again.
                There's not much I can do to help here, you need quick
                reactions and honestly a bit of luck in which notes he picks.
                Just try, try and try again, and soon that cooking slot will
                be yours.
                Note: For beating him a second time, I got a Hand Roll. Haha.
Rewards:        Third Cooking Slot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, once you have "beaten" him, he will drop a dish - you can now cook with
three items anywhere, not just at a kitchen! Neat. Take the Sea Turtle back to
Arnassi Ruins.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time head back to the main room then all the way to the top of the cave.
The rooms off the main path on the way contain nothing but some plants and
Seahorses.

At the top, Beast Form through the current to the left, then leap the rock to
fight the mighty...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Crabbius Maximus
Location:       Arnassi Ruins
Attacks:        Blubbles - Just kidding, they're actually just energy blasts.
                Three, large pink balls, moderate homing capabilities.
                Alley-oop - Once his arms are gone, Mr Maximus will leap into
                the air on occasion. Please try not to be above him when that
                happens.
Hints:          The only bits not under 20ft of armour seem to be his eyes!
                Wow, glowing red marks on his arms! That's subtle.
                Okay, so he's 'armless. Now what?
                I tell you, when he jumps over me, that's one ugly target on
                his backside.
Guide:          A pretty straight forward, and, dare I say it, fun battle!
                Start by getting used to the width of the area. When he stops
                to launch some blasts at you, shoot some of your own at his
                eyestalks while avoiding them. They'll flash red, and once you
                hit one several times, the crab will collapse, revealing the
                red spots on his arms. Target one and fill it full of energy,
                until it explodes. Repeat for the second arm.
                Okay, so now he's armless, time to focus on that strange
                octopus thing on his butt. Sprint-swim over the top of him,
                he'll bend down and jump above you. Release a fully charged
                energy blast as he's above you, and the shots should home in
                on his butt and do some damage. Repeat this a few more times,
                making sure to not get hit when he jumps up, and he's soon
                toast. You can also use Nature Form's thorns to accomplish
                this, but where's the fun in that?!
Reward:         Crab Armour
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations, that wasn't so hard now was it? Head back right, and out of
the Arnassi Ruins for good.

Seahorses on it, and some musical notes. Play those notes to start the Arnassi
Challenge minigame.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--==ARNASSI CHALLENGE==--

Location: Open Waters 4, through the current halfway down the stage.

The Arnassi Challenge is a speed race against the clock. Through this area of
the ruins, you will have no doubt seen the blue spirit-like orb floating
throughout this area. That marks the race, as do the white-gemstone holding
Kappa turtles. You need to accomplish three laps of this race in under the
default record time of 1:30 to get the prize. It's not too difficult, so long
as you keep your wits about you, and watch out for the Rockhead fish on your
way round!

Some tips:
- Use Fish Form! It is the fastest form and you won't win without it.
- Use Spirit Form! Those blue gems are not there for aesthetic purposes. Time
  freezes when in spirit form, so activate down the way from the blue
  gemstone, then drift over to it at your own pace. Saves you a few seconds
  each lap.
- Use the quick-switch keys for the forms. 6 is Fish and 7 is Spirit.

Using these tips you shouldn't have much trouble.

Whew. Now that's done, head back out to the main part of the Open Waters. Take
the upper left path to Open Waters 3

Head up a little to find a save point, then head left. At the split, go down,
through the creepy Leech filled cave, but bear down and left to find an
to the equally creepy King's Grave cave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head left and up - the song plant in the bottom left only contains a Deep
Shrimp. The one in the very top left contains a Perogi, however - it is guarded
by a Chomper!

Head left afterwards, until you find some steam vents. Spirit Form in between
them, and grab the King's Skull treasure down below. After that, leave the same
way you came in - there is no need to explore further.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you head basically exactly right from where you exit, you'll come to another
Chomper guarding 2 healing poultices.

After grabbing those, head down and right, heading back into Open Waters 4.

Welcome to The Abyss. I hope you're used to The Sun Form by now. Okay, head
down. For those of you who do not want any extra bonus items here either, your
goal is either of the pathways that lead to the area to the left. I'm sure you
can get their on your own, no?

For those who do want cool stuff, take a right at the first split, watching out
for the Tunicate, that horrible thing. Keep following the path, and then head
aaaaaaaaall the way down. Watch out for all kinds of nasties on your trip, but
mainly those Tunicates.

At the bottom, Spirit Form through the steam to your right, then continue right
to end up in...

ENEMIES:       Crab, Ice Jelly, Ice Shrimp, Spooter
ITEMS:         Ice Cream x4, Dumbo Ice Cream

What a nice change of scenery. Head right, then up and left. You'll find some
Ice Cream in the song plant at the top left of this little cave.

Keep following the path and you'll find another Ice Cream in an offshoot cave
on the right, then two more to your left in the next cave. There's also a
Dumbo Ice Cream in the same cave on the right, behind a large ice crystal.

After grabbing all the frozen treats you can carry, shoot upwards.

ENEMIES:       Ice Jelly, Ice Shrimp, Beluga, Porpoise, Ice Otter, Seahorse

ITEMS:         Crab Cake, Cold Borscht

Hang a left. This place is going to test your Beast Form jumping to the max.
At the very left point, you need to launch yourself out of the water to land on
the ice crystal sticking out of the rock. Yes, it's very possible.

Once there, you need to do some ricochet jumps - leaping from one surface to
another rapidly to avoid falling off. You need to just keep climbing this cave,
using the ice crystals as ledges - leap to walls, to the underside of crystals,
back to walls, to the tops of the crystals, etc.

Eventually with any luck, you'll be at the top of the cave, faced with a giant
bubble. Jump into it. Now your task is to jump from bubble to bubble across
the Frozen Veil - I find it much easier to do this in Song or Energy Form,
something without the overbearing kick of Beast Form, but it's up to you.

Not much I can say to help here, other than make real good use of the Look
ability (E key or middle mouse click) to see where the next bubble is.
Good luck, read on when you're inside the Bubble Cave on the other side.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside Bubble Cave, head over to the right side and jump up one or two bubbles
to save. There's a Crab Cake in the song plant to the left and slightly above
the save point, guarded by a .. Rot Worm? How did that get there? Oh well.

Head up some more bubbles and stick right, you'll find the Cold Borscht recipe
hiding in the top right-est bubble, under an ice crystal.

Once you got that, head back left and keep climbing, climbing, until at last,
you find the...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mantis Shrimp Prime
Location:       Bubble Caves
Attacks:        Explosives - The Shrimp launches several of these slow moving
                explosive devices at you from his perch on the ceiling. When
                they come into contact with you or a wall they explode and
                release a circle of small yellow energy bolts.
Hints:          He looks pretty comfy on his bit of land there. If only there
                was some way of turning nature against him?
                Those bombs look nasty. Much more damaging than anything you
                can fire at him!
Guide:          Pretty easy when you know how, but you'll probably still take
                a bunch of damage, so come prepared.
                Begin by binding one of his bombs as he fires them at you.
                It'll trail behind you and slowly get redder until it
                explodes! Before that happens, quickly switch to nature form.
                Fire a Thorn (right-click charge) at his position and it'll
                knock him off his perch into the bubble you are in. Get out
                of the way! Once he's stuck there, either swim around him in
                circles until the bomb explodes (if you are far enough away
                you can easily dodge the bolts) or if you have time, switch
                to normal form and unbind the bomb. Either way, if it explodes
                near him it damages him.
                Once this is done, he'll shriek out and jump to the ceiling
                again. Simply repeat this twice more to get your (hopefully)
                final health upgrade!
Rewards:        Verse Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was quite possibly the funniest boss death in the game.

Leave. Leave the cave, leave the Ice Veil, leave the Ice Cavern, all the way
back to, yes, I'm sorry...

ENEMIES:       Wisp, Deep Jellyfish, Deep Urchin, Deep Eel, Slender Eel
               Angler Fish, Plasmaworm, Predatory Tunicate, Triffle
               Deep Shrimp, Spiny Crab
ITEMS:         Verse Egg, Dumbo Ice Cream Healing Poultice, Hot Borscht

Head left and hit up the save point. One done, come back out and around,
sticking to the left wall. Head left and down as soon as you can, then all the
way right to find another Ancient Sea Turtle. Head back left until you see
a lantern - hit it with a charged Sun Form shot to open the door. Head left.

Use Spirit Form to pass the steam vents, then head left to meet the Whale! He
doesn't do much, just sits there.. until you sing the Whale song you found in
Open Waters 4. Remember it? I hope you wrote it down.

Fine, fine, it was RED - BLUE - PURPLE - BLUE - AQUA

Head inside the Whale. Look, just take my word for it, okay?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the save point if you want, then head left. Inside the first open house
are 6 Huggy! Sing to get them to stick to you if you want some health.
Underneath the house is the very last Verse Egg, just chilling out. Woo.

At the very back, you'll find another open hut with a strange octopus-like
creature within. Hang around him for a while and he'll sing 4 notes:

PURPLE - BLUE - YELLOW - AQUA

However, singing them seems to do no good. Head back outside this little hut.

You notice the unlit lanterns hanging around? Hit one with a charged Sun Form
shot, and it'll sing a note. Ahh. You need to hit these lanterns in the order
that thing is singing. Here's the right order:

- The one above the house the octopus is in.
- The one far to the right, inbetween three ruined houses.
- The one to the left of the last one.
- The one to the left of that, below the Chateu de Octopus.

Once you light them all in the right order, you'll hear a chime. Note that if
you don't light them fast enough you'll need to start again.

Back in the little hut, the door will have vanished and you can claim the
pearl back there. Yes, that's what we came for. Bind it and leave the
Whale.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the back of this cave behind the whale is a song plant containing a Dumbo
Ice Cream. There's also a mega hidden easter egg here, but I'm not going to
tell you what it is. If you really want to know, check the Hidden Sidequests
area after the guide to find out.

Pearl in tow, drag it back through the steam vents, use Sun Form to charge the
lamp below the door to exit this area. Then swim up, around the large
rock in the middle of this area, and then up still through the twisting tunnel.
Place it in the holder at the end, blast it, and find Naija's final lost
memory! And a lost save point, apparently. Head back out of the twisty tunnel.

Head left and follow the ceiling wall as it twists around. Your goal is that 
slightly larger open area near the top of the level. In it is a rock hiding
a Healing Poultice carrying song plant, if that helps.

Just above that is a hidden tunnel full of current washing you left. It shows
on the map, so is not too hard to find.

Just outside it, to the bottom right, is a Hot Borscht! Then head left to..

ENEMIES:       Wisp, Deep Jellyfish, Deep Urchin, Deep Eel, Slender Eel
               Angler Fish, Plasmaworm, Predatory Tunicate, Triffle
               Deep Shrimp, Spiny Crab, Deepcrawlers
ITEMS:         Healing Poultice, Cold Borscht, Sight Poultice
TREASURE:      Glowing Plant, Glowing Seed, Jellyfish Costume

This area contains two very hidden secrets - so hidden that if you don't
already know where to look you'll almost never find them.

First one is near the start, follow the wall below you, and as it dips down to
the left, keep nudging the wall - eventually you'll pass through, into a secret
area that holds the Glowing Plant treasure.

Leave this secret room by the lower exit, and head straight down past the Deep
Urchin to find two Healing Poultice. Head left, and at the split, head up.
At the next split, head down and to the left.

Now, on this path, as you pass the 2nd Tunicate, if you pay close attention to
the spikes on the ceiling here, you'll notice some are darker - these are fake.
Pass through them to find another Cold Borscht.

Head back the way you came and down, and at the split head up and left. You'll
enter an area full of creepy Spiny Crabs, but your goal is the large cave
at the end. There, at the bottom of the area, you'll find the Glowing Seed
treasure.

Head back out of ths creepy Spiny Crab tunnels to the split, then go down,
right and up into a little offshoot cave with a save point.

Okay, time for the final optional boss. If you don't want to fight it, scroll
down to where we talk about blue bulbs. If you do want to fight it, read on.

After saving head back left, then up and back to the upper right. On the right
wall, you'll see a rock, bind it out of the way. Inside, on the right side of
this little loop, you'll find a hidden fish tunnel - swim through it, then
in this little cave, head up. Good luck.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           King Jellyfish God Prime
Location:       The Abyss
Attacks:        Life! - The Jellyfish creates several little tiny pink
                jellyfish, which follow you around. They hurt on impact, and
                also shunt you out of the way.
                Death! - The Jellyfish glows in three point around it's eye,
                and a second later electric will shoot out of these points.
                They will then spin either clockwise or anti-clockwise for a
                few seconds, before changing direction. They then disappear.
Hints:          His eye. HIS EYE.
                It looks protected, apart from that one little gap.
                GOD DAMMIT THIS IS TOO HARD!!
Guide:          This guy is actually held by many as harder than the final
                boss. He can be,  depending on your play style. However, with a
                few healing items and a few tricks, he is not too bad. Begin by
                swimming up into his room, the camera will swoop over to his
                eye and he'll ominously begin lowering. If you came in by
                accident, this is your cue to leave, otherwise.. switch to
                Energy Form. He can only be damaged by shots to the unguarded
                part of his eye - a shield spins around his eye, so basically
                just keep shooting while swimming around him and hope some
                shots get through. The Baby Blaster Peg pet and Li are highly
                recommended for this fight. He'll start by summoning 3 or 4
                baby jellyfish, which will follow you around. Ignore them for
                now, and pound away at his eye. Soon, some spots will glow.
                Change to Beast Form, and avoid the lightning that blasts from
                these spots, while eating as many tiny jellyfish as possible to
                keep their numbers down. Eventually, this fight becomes a
                spamming-energy-blasts-while-chomping-on-food-items fight, as
                he starts summoning 6-10 jellyfish at a time. Keep piling the
                damage on his eye, though, and he'll go down in the end. Keep
                in mind, keys 1-8 change form. I didn't know this the first
                time, so it is doable by singing, but it was 150% harder.
Rewards:        Jellyfish Costume
                Special Bulb
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good job. If you managed it, that is. Regardless of the outcome, head back to
the save point.

Once saved, use the blue bulb to the lower right.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head out and straight down to nab a Sight Poultice in a little cave through a
fish tunnel, then follow the long tunnel left. The way right is blocked for
now.

The tunnel is full of Deepcrawlers, that shy away at the light, but you'll
still probably have to blast a path through them. Just be patient.

At the end of the long, multi-enemy filled tunnel, you'll find a big metal
door. Right click it and Li will unlock it, clearing the way to...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/----------------\
| THE SUNKEN CITY| #AQWALK015
\----------------/
ENEMIES:       Scavenger, Spookfish, Slender Eel
ITEMS:         Sea Cake, Spicy Roll
TREASURE:      Girl's Costume

Pretty funky music, no? One thing to note about the Sunken City is that items
are contained in small destroyable crates. Li and your pet will automatically
attack these crates, and they contain a Sea Cake, near the start, and various
basic ingredients throughout.

Blaze through the ruined city, being extremely wary of the Scavengers - these
insectoid things are a pain to defeat. Follow the path to the next area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you go up at the first split, just after where you see a spooky ghost child,
you come to another save point. At the next split, after seeing the child
climbing down the wall, head up and around, use Spirit Form to pass the steam
to get the revealing Girl's Costume.

Head back through the steam and down at the split - the child will run right,
into the land of dark tunnels. He'll set up camp right at the end of them -
swim there in Sun Form, get close to him, then slowly lead him back to the
woman at the split. If you go too fast he'll get lost and you'll need to go
back and start again.

Child will then run off left, and the woman will sing a very familiar song. See
if you can mimick it, then follow the child left. After the tunnels, you'll
find the child cowering in front of a tree. Head right and you'll see a ghost
girl with some ghost flowers. In the least obvious puzzle ever, you need to
switch to Nature Form and make a path of flowers (non-charged right clicks)
from the girl to the boy, and the girl will follow. When she gets to the boy,
he'll run off again.

At the next split, head left, and you'll find three faceless bullies heckling
the child. If you get close to the child, they'll turn into Scavengers that you
need to defeat. The child will then sprint past you to the right.

He'll finally stop in front of a locked door. A weird symbol made of notes
appears on the wall. Welcome to the bit where everyone gets stuck.

Good luck.










Okay, fine. You need to sing the song the game has been singing since the
start, the song the woman was singing at the split a few minutes ago. The
symbol and the notes that create it do help, but if you cant figure it out,
here it is:

AQUA - PURPLE - RED - ORANGE
AQUA - PURPLE - RED - BLUE
AQUA - PURPLE - RED - GREEN

This needs to be done as one long song. When done correctly, the door opens.
Proceed..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save. For the love of Weird Al, save. Head into the main chamber to find the
child crying on the floor again. Swim up through the current.

In this maze area, you need to find 3 pieces of blue clay, bind them, and bring
them to the child. Also note the pink jellyfish that can only be defeated by
eating it in Beast Form. Also also note the Spicy Roll to the left of the upper
most piece of clay.

Once you drag all three pieces of clay, one from the right, one from the top
and one from the left, back to the child, his creation will come to life. Say
hey to...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Golem
Location:       The Sunken City
Required Forms: Energy, Beast, Light
Attacks:        Charge! - The Golem puts it's hammer arms out in front of it
                and rams you at high speed. Swim over the top of him.
                Body Slam - The Golem leaps and attempts to smash you. Dart
                under him.
                Energy Bolts - When the Priest goes on the offensive she fires
                energy bolts at you. Just keep moving to avoid them.
Critical Mode:  The Priest starts firing energy bolts at you and the Golem
                attacks much faster and non-stop.
Hints:          The Golem is invincible. It seems the Priest is helping it.
                Those little Jellyfish are immune to fire. Jellyfish taste
                nice, though. Yum.
                Defeat one with what the other provides.
Guide:          It may take a few tries to get used to the pattern of this
                boss, but once you manage it he's not too bad.
                Begin by dodging three of his attacks, either swimming over him
                when he charges or darting under him when he jumps. After
                dodging three times, the Priest will swim up to his face and
                pat him on the head, releasing a small purple jellyfish. Switch
                to Beast Form and charge it to eat it. Dodge another three
                attacks, but this time when the Priest swims up to pat the
                Golem, shoot her with Beast form's right-click. The Golem will
                get kinda mad and start attacking you pretty fast, switch to
                Energy Form and blast him to pieces while dodging his attacks.
                After a short while, the Priest will wake up and you'll need
                to repeat the process.
                Eventually the Golem will go red and be permanently vulnerable
                to your Energy shots, so keep smashing that right click button
                and dodge his even faster attacks. Keep in mind the Priest will
                also join in now and attempt to shoot you down. Energy Shot
                +damage foods are your friend here!
                Once the Golem takes enough damage, it dies and the fight
                is over.
Rewards:        Loneliness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Those were the kids parents!? No wonder he was crying all the time. Anyway, now
that Naija is all mopey and angry, leave The Sunken City. Yep, no shortcuts,
just a long loney trip back into...

               Deep Shrimp, Spiny Crab, Deepcrawlers

As you leave, you'll see the ghost boy removing the.. tongue, as it's
officially called, from the far part of The Abyss. Swim out of the enemy filled
tunnel, past where you got the Sight Poultice, to where the tongue is now
absent. Descend into.. ugh..

               Gateway, Biteymouth, Abaddon
ITEMS:         Arcane Poultice x4, Spicy Roll, Volcano Roll, Divine Soup
               Plump Perogi

Yes, this place is actually a living body, complete with organs and blood cells
and.. lots and lots of parasites. Including you, technically. Head left at the
first split to find a save point at the end of the tunnel. One note: blood
vessels are completely harmless.

Head back to the main tunnel and then take the current right - this will lead
you to a large room containing Li in a crystal bubble! There is unfortunately
nothing you can do for him now - take the lower left current to reach the main
room of The Body. Note that as soon as you leave the current tunnel, there is
a song plant containing 2 plant leaves directly above you.

This part of The Body is split into three sections - this part, the main area,
a set of tunnels to the left, and two sets of tunnels to the right. The entire
left area is open onto itself, but the two sections of the right area must be
accessed seperately via this main area.

For now, head left and down, avoiding the many, many Virus Pods and Mutant
Jellyfish until you reach a large circular current. Take the upper left tunnel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just note that the ceilings of these tunnels are littered with Horrors, while
the floors and walls are littered with Grabbyarms. The background also contains
multiple Biteymouths - basically, always be on full alert.

Head left and briefly down to access a current tunnel - allow it to carry you,
but get off at the first tunnel above you. There's a song plant containing a
Spicy Roll right here, and if you follow the tunnel along, doing your best to
avoid or defeating the plethora of enemies that try to stop you, in the very
top room you will find three things - a crystal, containing a Krotite Warrior.
Touch it to free his spirit. You'll also find an Arcane Poultice and a Volcano
Roll to the left and above you, respectively.

Head back down, fighting your way through the Virus Pods and Mutant Jellyfish.
Take the first tunnel down, then bear right in the current and take the first
exit leading down. If you bump into another Virus Pod, you took the right
exit. Head down and left, and on the upper wall you'll find a Diving Soup being
guarded by two Mutileyes.

Take the lower left tunnel, dealing with the Horror when it appears, and right
at the end you'll find another Arcane Poultice along with a crystal containing
none other than Prince Drask of Mithalas! Take his spirit too and then head
right.

You need to get back to the main part of The Body now - either take the upper
path and deal with the currents and regular enemies, or take the lower path to
deal with darkness, spikes and the irritating Abaddon enemies. There are no
items on the lower route, so it's really up to you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once back in The Body, part 1, head right across the giant Virus Pod filled
arena. On the right side, take the lower rightmost route.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the empty tunnel, take the current and get off at the next available
tunnel. Fight your way up, past the 3 million Virus Pods, and deal with the two
Horrors at the top. Take the little deadend tunnel up top to find a
Plump Perogi. Head back to the main path.

Not much to advise on here, keep ploughing right, through the 50 Mutilus they
throw at you. Touch the crystal for an Erulian spirit, and bust the song plant
for a, surprise! Arcan Poultice. See a pattern here? Leave this area the way
you came, then, once back in the main room of The Body, take the upper
rightmost path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heehee, I saved the best for last. Head along the tunnel, taking either route
around the circle. This path adds a new hazard - Biteymouths. Just avoid their
chomps, as they are invincible. Just something to look out for while already
dodging the Virus Pod spikes.

Once the two tunnels join up, it's nothing but Biteymouths from here on. For
the best experience, switch to Fish Form and blast through as fast as possible!
It's a lot of fun. Although, as long as you keep moving, the Biteymouths will
never be fast enough to chomp you in any form.

Follow the current to the bottom room, and snatch up the last Arcane Poultice
while freeing the Druniad spirit.

Head aaaaall the way back, yes, through the Biteymouth tunnel, through Virus
Pod County, back to the main part of The Body.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case Naija's bluntness was not enough of a hint - it's time to free Li. That
rhymes. Cool. Head back to his prison, it's in the large room to the upper
right if you have forgotten.

Head remotely near his prison, and the invisible choir in the background will
sing 4 notes. You have 4 spirits circling you. They are coloured. They happen
to be coloured the same as the notes the choir sings.

Sing those 4 notes. They are TEAL - PURPLE - RED - ORANGE for the tone-deaf
amongst you.

Woo, Li's out, and you get your final form!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| DUAL FORM | TEAL - PURPLE - RED - ORANGE
              Dual Form is quite interesting. It is actually two seperate
              forms, hence the name. The one you start in is Li's form. It is
              kinda greenish blue. Right click alone does not do anything, but
              if you charge it up like Energy Form, it releases several large
              blue shots that travel in a straight line. It is very powerful,
              but lacks the lock-on effect of Energy Form. However, if you kill
              three enemies with this, you will absorb their life essence.. or
              something, and you'll hear a scream.
              Now, if you Spin in Li's Form, you'll turn into Naija's Form.
              This form is pink. Because Naija's a girl. And girls like pink.
              Good job, Bit Blot.
              Naija's Form is defenseless on its own, but after killing three
              enemies in Li's form, then charging a right click and releasing,
              Naija will emit a scream that will kill, or at least severely
              damage, all enemies on screen, plus a few that aren't even on
              the screen.
              This is the most devestating attack you can do in the game, but
              because of the buildup required it is really only useful in a few
              specific situations.
              Spin in Naija's Form to turn back into Li's Form, if you didn't
              guess already.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neat. Head back out to the main room of The Body, then straight down, trying
out Li's Form on the enemies as you go.

In the lower tunnel, continue killing as you swim left. Eventually you'll find
a Gateway, a large black internal organ blocking your path. The game will tell
you to switch to Naija's Form and scream at it - do so, and it'll explode. Hit
up the save point just beyond it, then head down to come to...

| THE GAUNTLET  | #AQWALK017
\---------------/
ENEMIES:       Mutileye, Mutilus, Virus Pod, Ground Shocker, Horror, Crawlvirus
               Mutant Jellyfish, Abyss Octopus, Mutated Naija, Grabbyarm
               Gateway, Biteymouth, Abaddon
ITEMS:         Long Life Soup, Spicy Roll
TREASURES:     Mutant Costume

Okay, so the game doesn't give it a specific name, but the music is so pumping
here and there are like a zillion enemies, fans have given this place the
unofficial name of The Gauntlet. Take a look at your map and cower in fear.

The idea of this map is basic, stick you against tons and tons of enemies, and
place 3 Gateways across the map, barring your progress, forcing you to use Dual
Form to proceed. The way I deal with this map is keep in Energy Form for 95% of
it - I much prefer the homing capabilities over Dual Form's increased damage.
But, it's up to you.

There's really not much to guide you on here - there are only a few items on 
the whole map, and it's really linear. Just keep plodding along, chugging
items as you go if you need to. One thing I can say is, take out the Abyss
Octopi first. These guys will blast you into tomorrow if you don't take them
out quickly. One or two Li blasts will take them out, but a few seconds of
Energy Form will do the same. Oh, and ignore Abaddons - these weird smiley
faces are such a pain to kill, just swim past them.

Prepare to see a lot more Horrors after the first Gateway - always suspect
your ceilings, people!

The first item is after Gateway #1, you'll find a room full of Mutant Jellies.
On the lower right side of this room is a Long Life Soup in a song plant.

A little way after this, you'll find your first Mutant Naija - these purple
freaks blast song notes at you, but not the good kind! Avoid their projectiles
and blast them down. This is easy when there is only one, but soon you'll be
fighting them three, four, five at a time! I hope your mouse isn't tired.

Item number two comes after Gateway #2. You'll find a room of 
various enemies, including Abaddons - look at your map, and you'll see small
compartment off to the left. The entrance to this is hidden in some fake,
darker spikes, just like the hidden rooms in The Abyss, although these
spikes are really not obviously fake unless you know it. Swim through where
the map dictactes, light the room up with some Sun, and nab the Mutant
Costume. If you have followed the guide, your Treasure list is now complete,
woo! If not, there's a list after the guide of all the treasures in
clockwise order, to help you track down the missing ones.

Head back out, and follow the route to Gateway #3. Along the way, after
clearing a room of two Abyss Octopi, you'll come across a room I lovingly
call the Room Of A Million Mutilus, Seriously You Guys. It contains,
roughly, 1 million Mutilus. The best way to deal with this, I've found,
is to lure them back, 400-900 at a time, to the large Octopus room you
were just in, and deal with them there. Last time I fought them, only
one dropped any health at all. Good times.

Anyway, now that your hand has a cramp from hammering the right click
button so much, head to the very left of the Room Of A Million Mutilus,
Seriously You Guys. You'll find a Spicy Roll in a song plant therein.

Head down, smashing Mutant skulls as you go. When you hit the bottom
and start heading right, I heavily suggest charging up Li Form. Once
it's done, switch to Naija, pile through the remaining 50 mutants
and the large circle of Mutilus that attack, and release the scream
on the final Gateway. Hopefully this will exterminate the thousands
of enemies there too, but if now, just sprint to the right to exit
the area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/------------\
| THE HEART  | #AQWALK018
\--- --------/
ITEMS:         Dumbo Ice Cream

Again, this place is not specially named in the game, but oh well. Hit the save
point, then use the nature pod thing to find an.. Ancient Sea Turtle. Here.
What the hell has it been eating to survive? Oh well. In the song plants around
him (her?) you will find 4 plant leaves, 4 eel oil and the last Special Bulb.

Use this opportunity to head back to safer waters and collect ingredients - try
to have a healthy supply of all good healing items, poison removal items and
Energy Shot + items on hand. Also check out Naija's House if you haven't been
keeping up with all the treasures you've collected - it's changed quite a bit
since the start of the game.

Once you are sure you are ready, head back to the save point. Save one last
time, then head right.

You swim past a lot of busts on the wall behind you - I can pick them all
out. You have Nautilus Prime, Crabbius Maximus, Octopus Prime, the giant Turtle
Momma, the Fallen God, the Arnassi, the Erulian, the Krotite, the Drunian, the
guys from The Sun Temple, Mithala, pre-corruption, then a Mithalan, then..
Naija?

Mithala said Naija was the thirteenth. According to this list, she is. Huh.
Anyway, swim right.

Haha, bet you were expecting a big boss, huh? No, just a 40 minute Metal Gear
Solid style cutscene, where you find out Naija is actually a man, and Li is
the doctor that's been caring for him while he's been in a coma. What a plot
twist!

No, just kidding. You get to fight...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator MKI
Location:       The Body
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Creation - The Creator lives up to his name and creates either
                evil Pink Jellyfish, or a Mutilus.
                Energy Storm - The Creator raises one hand and fires countless
                energy bolts from it. I found the easiest way to dodge this is
                to just sit in a corner near him. You do get hit a bit but not
                nearly as much as if you swim around.
Hints:          Not much strategy to this guy.
Guide:          Simply blast his face while avoiding or killing the enemies.
                When he casts his energy storm sit tight and wait for it to
                end before swimming around again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whew. Glad that's all over.. wait, his face fell off? Aw, hell naw...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator MKII
Location:       The Body
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Face Laser - The Creator emits a giant laser from his face
                which cuts up whichever wall he is facing. He does turn around
                when you swim over him, but if you time it right you can dodge
                the attack.
                Poison Balls - The Creator fires several ugly red homing balls
                of poison at you. They do contact damage AND poison you, and
                they are rather hard to avoid so I hope you stocked up on
                items before coming in.
                Grab - If you are level with his arms he will try and grab you,
                and you will continually take damage until you spin yourself
                free. This is incredibly difficult to get out of sometimes, so
                try not to get caught by it.
Hints:          Another straightforward fight. Blast his face off! Uh.. what's
                left of it!
Guide:          A straight slogging fight. Use any Energy Shot+ foods you may
                have, and cure yourself whenever you get poisoned. This is
                near the end, so do not be worried about using your items!
                Good luck!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He's on the run! Chase him down, getting creepier and creepier as we go.

Note: In the next big boss arena, to the very bottom in the centre there is a
Dumbo Ice Cream of all things in a song plant. What the? Oh well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator..!? MKIII
Location:       The Body
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Bite - When in front of his giant pincers he will jab forward
                and try to bite you.
                Ram - When hurt (or just randomly sometimes if he feels like
                it) he will try to ram past you. Kinda hard to dodge as he's
                so big and fast.
Hints:          Now you have him on the retreat! Chase him down.
                Like all one eyed bosses, his eye is probably the weak point.
                Trouble is, how do you make him put his guard down?
Guide:          Now he's running away, pfft. Chase him through the
                progressively darkening tunnel, switching to Sun Form near
                the end. When you enter the big three-circle area, slowly drift
                around blasting sunlight around. When you find the boss,
                approach him in Energy Form and repeatedly strike him. He'll
                open his pincers to lunge at you, and hopefully a blast will
                hit him in the eye. At this point he will charge past you so
                cling to a wall, then switch back to Sun Form and track him
                down again. Rinse and repeat. After a few blasts he'll retreat
                to the small room to the right (Look on your map). Follow him
                there and blast him one or two more times as per normal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, good job, now he's reduced to.. some.. weird puppet. Go go boss
design!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator MKIV
Location:       The Body (I wanna say something cool like The Heart but no
                official names are given!)
Required Forms: None
Attacks:        Song - The Creator can sing just like you! Whichever notes he
                sings come to life and track you down. They move slowly, so
                simply swim around them.
Hints:          It doesn't look like he takes any damage from your attacks.
                I guess there is nothing left to do but sing!
Guide:          It's a simple Simon Says battle. He sings three notes, they
                come after you, and you must sing the same notes while dodging
                them. You don't need to sing them all in a row, but you do need
                to sing them in order. If you sing all three without getting
                hit by any of them, he takes damage. If not, you take damage.
                Repeat this several times. If your reaction time is actually
                short enough, you can just hover directly over the Creator and
                sing the notes as soon as they appear, meaning you don't need
                to swim about, dodging them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                He'll die, you win! Congratulations on beating Aquaria.


                Nah, just kidding.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator
Location:       Nowhere
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Energy Blasts - The Creator can summon huge homing energy
                blasts from his hand and from his mouth, at least for the first
                part of the battle. Dodge them and let them arc around you
                before dodging again.
                Creation - He can create a single Mutant Naija enemy from his
                hand. Take it out when it shows up to stop it annoying you.
                Creation2 - When you damage his chest cavity in the 2nd half of
                the fight, he summons a few Mutilus for you to charge up on.
                Thanks, God!
                Destruction - Hey, he can do both! For the latter part of this
                battle his chest cavity fires this incredibly potent laser at
                you periodically. It's very easy to avoid if you don't go
                anywhere near it, unfortunately it fires from his weak point.
                The screen goes dark blue for a few seconds before he fires
                this, so you have been warned.
Hints:          1st part: His face worked on the last few forms, try it again!
                          Hmm, his eye is poking out but it's still attached.
                          It looks pretty dark. Dark. Dark!
                          Right, now that doesn't work either, but it doesn't
                          look like it's attached anymore. If only I could
                          pull it out!
                2nd part: Right, well he's majorly pissed off now. What's that
                          in his chest-mouth micro-seconds before he fires?
                          Hm, doesn't seem to take damage from Energy Form.
                          Well, Li's back now, maybe he can think of something?
                          Ok, that seems to hurt him, but it looks like he
                          could go on like this all day. If only I had an even
                          MORE potent attack!
Guide:          1st part: Jeez. Ok, time to show him what we've learned! Switch
                          to Energy Form. Blast his face to pieces while
                          avoiding the energy blasts and killing any enemies he
                          summons. Soon enough, his faceguard will shatter
                          and.. ew, his eye pops out! Switch to Sun Form. Throw
                          a fully charged sunbeam in his eye and.. it shines.
                          Blast it to shreds with Energy Form! If the eye stops
                          shining before you damage it enough, repeat the
                          sunbeam/energy form combo until it goes black. At
                          which point, switch to neutral/song form and Bind it!
                          Get out of the way, quick!
                2nd part: Li is back! We're in business. He stops firing blasts
                          from his mouth, however he does keep firing them from
                          his hand. Switch to Dual Form and head south.
                          Yuck! What the hell is that? Charge up a Li blast.
                          Wait for it... wait for it... the screen goes dark
                          blue, the mouth starts opening, fire! Make sure you
                          get out of the way, quickly. You need to fire the
                          second the head inside his mouth is visible, and then
                          dart directly up or down. I find it easier to use the
                          keyboard for this. If you DO get hit, well, I hope
                          you have a ton of healing stuff left over. Once you
                          smash the head in his mouth with a Li blast, he
                          releases some handy Nautilus for you to absorb. Kill
                          them with Li blasts while avoiding the Energy Blast
                          attacks of the Creator, and when you've killed three
                          switch to Naija Form. Swim up to the Creator's head
                          and let rip! The Creator won't be too happy with
                          that. Switch back to Li Form and repeat this all
                          twice more. Good luck!
Rewards:                  End Sequence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awwwright, good job. After one of the best boss death sequences I've ever seen,
you get the end sequence. For real this time. No more Creator forms. No, you
actually did it.

So, according to the end sequence, it seems the boy that fell from the island
at the start of the game was the Creator. How did that happen? He says an
ancient spirit bound with him, giving him God like powers. I guess that's
believable. I wonder where the spirit came from in the first place? Oh well,
there's always Aquaria 2...

You see the oceans restored to their former glory, all major civilizations
being rebooted. Then we refocus on Naija, feeling, as I imagine many
protagonists would when their adventures are all over, restless and longing
for adventure. But, as she says, that adventure would never come again.

Roll credits. The end!

Unless you found all 3 Lost Memories during gameplay, that is. In which case..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-----\
| ??? | 
\--- -/

Naija is in a strange spiral cave, and she was not here a moment ago. The only
thing to do is swim to the middle. The spikey tubes can hurt you, and you can
die, but luckily in the years that have passed between your last fight and now,
Naija has not removed any healing items from her.. pockets(?). I suggest a
Divine Soup to speed things along!

Once in the middle.. nope, I'm not going to spoil it. Beat the game with all
the memories yourself to find out.

Congratulations on really beating Aquaria!!

| SIDEQUESTS | #AQSIDEQUE
\------------/

There are not many sidequests or hidden areas in Aquaria, really, discounting
the optional bosses and treasures, which are covered in their own sections.

In fact, there are really only three that I can think of.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--==ARNASSI CHALLENGE==--
Location:         Open Waters 4, through the current halfway down the stage. At
                  the bottom of this area you will see some notes on a rock in
                  the background. Play these notes to start the challenge.

The Arnassi Challenge is a speed race against the clock. Through this area of
the ruins, you will have no doubt seen the blue spirit-like orb floating
throughout this area. That marks the race, as do the white-gemstone holding
Kappa turtles. You need to accomplish three laps of this race in under the
default record time of 1:30 to get the prize. It's not too difficult, so long
as you keep your wits about you, and watch out for the Rockhead fish on your
way round!

Some tips:
- Use Fish Form! It is the fastest form and you won't win without it.
- Use Spirit Form! Those blue gems are not there for aesthetic purposes. Time
  freezes when in spirit form, so activate down the way from the blue
  gemstone, then drift over to it at your own pace. Saves you a few seconds
  each lap.
- Use the quick-switch keys for the forms. 6 is Fish and 7 is Spirit.

Using these tips you shouldn't have much trouble.

Reward:         Arnassi Armor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--==SIMON SAYS==--
Location:        Arnassi Ruins, take the Ancient Sea Turtle located beyond the
                fish tunnel in the lower right hand corner of the ruins. You'll
                be taken to a secret area of The Kelp Forest containing this
                weird creature.

I hope you know what Simon Says is. Basically, this weird creature has one
large eye in the centre, and 8 small orbs around it, one for each note you can
sing. When you right click him, the "fight" begins. He'll sing a note by
blinking one of the coloured orbs. You need to repeat said note, quickly. He'll
then repeat the first note, and add a second. You need to then play these two
notes. He and you will then take turns, up until he is singing 8 notes in a
row. Get one wrong, or take too long, and he will roar and you'll need to right
click him to start all over again. There's not much I can do to help here, you
need quick reactions and honestly a bit of luck in which notes he picks. Just
try, try and try again, and soon that cooking slot will be yours.
Note: For beating him a second time, I got a Hand Roll. Haha.

Rewards:        Third Cooking Slot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--==SUPER SECRET BONUS SPOT==--
Location:      The Abyss, in the large cave that houses the stuck Blue Whale.
               Head behind the whale, and in the top left corner, there is a
               very hidden fish tunnel. Squeeze through it to find this spot.
This is the most useless, and not to mention ugly spot in the game. You have to
see it to believe it. Bleeueugh. Naija comments on the disgusting fish therein.

Rewards:       Absolutely nothing, except perhaps a lighter stomach. Ew.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| ENEMY LIST | #AQENEMYLI
\------------/

The creatures of Aquaria are varied and many, although fighting most of them
comes down to swimming around while firing blasts at them. Still, here is a
list of every enemy in the game, and even a few non-enemies. Descriptions,
fighting strategies, and even ingredients they drop are also listed.
Where possible, the official names, taken from the mod creator, were used.

Not all have indepth explanations, and there may even be a few missing, if I
didn't come across them on my two walkthrough-writing playthroughs. I name
the ones you will meet if you follow my walkthrough in the introduction to the
area, and usually again when you first meet them face to face. Find what they
are called, then search for their name here if you are having trouble defeating
them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abaddon
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        The Abaddon looks like a mask surrounded by solid arms,
                which rotate around it. It attacks by sending out energy blasts
                in a similarly rotating fashion. It is possible to kill if you
                manage to fit your own energy blasts between his arms as they
                turn, but it's not worth it. Avoid.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abyss Octopus
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        This guy is a solid-looking black octopus that slowly rotates
                as it drifts. It then charges up, and blasts a single laser
                very similar to the Rotted Cores back in Mithalas Cathedral!
                Luckily, two good shots from Dual Form can easily bring one
                down, just do it as fast as possible when multiple ones attack.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aggrohopper
Location:       Many places near the beginning of the game
Tactics:        These guys look like troll heads on two legs, and jump about
                angrily when you go near them. They hurt a lot on contact, and
                are quite accurate with their jumps, so blast them from a safe
                place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angler Fish
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        The Angler Fish is a much larger threat than the Angler Eel.
                Sitting silently until you come close, the Angler Fish will
                then utter a guttural roar, before charging at you at
                breakneck speed. It will then continue to swim around,
                repeating this behaviour until one of you lay dead.
                Several energy shots will be needed to destroy it.
Spoils:         Glowing Egg - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armapillar
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        These guys disguise themselves as rocks clinging to the walls,
                but when you draw near they open, revealing a single
                laser-blasting eye! Their shots are very powerful, but fly in
                an almost straight line, so are easy to avoid. I usually swim
                past these, skipping them altogether, but if you wish to defeat
                one, you'll have to shoot it a ton of times while it has its
                eye open.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Armored Fleas
Location:       Open Waters - Bone Cave, Mithalas City, Mithalas Cathedral
Tactics:        Tiny little blue grey blobs that jump when you get too near.
                They have no other attacks, but can be a pain to shoot.
                Try to fling a few shots at them when are in the air, as the
                homing ability on the energy blast has some trouble hitting
                the fleas when they are clinging to the walls.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby Aggrohopper
Location:       Many places near the beginning of the game
Tactics:        Like the Money Squid, these come with a nest that churns
                them out. Luckily, they aren't nearly as annoying - the babies
                will only attack if you go close, so just sit back and fill
                them full of energy from afar.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beluga
Location:       The Frozen Veil
Tactics:        Why you'd want to kill one of these cute little white whales
                is beyond me, but a few shots will do it. I just like to
                watch them blow bubbles!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bigmaul
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        The Bigmaul has no attacks of its own, but this floating
                purpley yellow thing can spawn tons of little baby Mauls, which
                dart in your direction and hurt you if you are near. Stay back,
                swim around a lot, and blast it to pieces. One strategy is to
                use Beast Form to swim through and eat all the little spawns,
                this will make shooting the Bigmaul down a lot easier.
Spoils:         Tasty Cake - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biteymouth
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        The Biteymouth is a big row of teeth in the background, which
                shoot forward and snap as you pass. Just swim past them as
                quickly as possible, they are not very fast. They are
                indestructible, though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blaster Peg
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These little weird things can be a bit of a pain, but they
                aren't too hard. They look like two little rocks, held together
                in the middle by something organic. They swim towards you, then
                fire a blast and swim away. Like many enemies in Aquaria, it's
                simply a matter of swimming out of the way, and replying with
                some energy blasts of your own. 2 or 3 will take down a Peg.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blazer
Location:       Mithalas City, Mithalas Cathedral
Tactics:        I have no idea if these are shrimp or crabs or whatever, but
                they are little red things with a glowing yellow ball behind.
                They travel in straight diagonal lines, leaving a path of red
                orbs behind them. Do not touch these orbs! Simply shoot the
                shrimp.. thing a bunch of times to kill it, avoiding the path
                it leaves behind.
Spoils:         Spicy Meat - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Jellyfish
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Totally harmless, these large blue jellyfish are always a
                welcome sight. Take them out with a few shots, and they nearly
                always leave behind some health - and usually more!
Spoils:         Jelly Oil - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Castle Crab
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        These blue lobstery crabs sit in a little pile of rocks,
                occasionally emerging to throw them at you! Avoid their rocks
                and repay their kindness with some energy blasts when they
                peek out of their home.
Spoils:         A small rock, for some reason!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chomper
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        Much like the Seawolf, this guy sits in a dark alleyway and
                waits for you to swim past, then bam! You can tell if he's seen
                you because his yellow eyes light up. Unlike the Barracuda,
                however, you can actually kill this guy with a few sharp shots
                to the back.
Spoils:         Spicy Steak - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clockwork Crab
Location:       The Sun Temple
Tactics:        The Robot Crab has two attacks, one will launch it's large
                pincer ahead of itself, which will hurt if you touch the pincer
                or the chain, and the other will launch several black balls
                directly at your face. Dodge them like you do any other energy
                blasts, but prioritize the Clockwork Crab over it's other robot
                friends.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clockwork Fish
Location:       The Sun Temple
Tactics:        This odd fish swims back and forth, just shoot it up a bit to
                get rid of it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crab
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Crabs come in a few different flavours, but the tactics remain
                the same. Crabs crawl along the walls of Aquaria, and pretty
                much mind their own business. Some move faster than others, but
                they all leave you alone. They do hurt to touch, though, so do
                not collide with them. They also take quite a beating, but
                beating them can be worth it if you are hunting ingredients.
Spoils:         Crab Meat - Uncommon
                Rotten Meat - Uncommon (Mithalas Cathedral)
                Ice Chunk - Uncommon (Ice Cavern)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crawlvirus
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        This tiny thing is simply a crystal on legs. It fires homing
                blasts at you, but it cannot take much punishment before it
                dies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crawpappy
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These cute little pincer-less lobsters swim harmlessly left and
                right. Blast them a few times if you are feeling cruel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crotoid
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These are brown rock-like fish with red spikes, they patrol on
                a set depth to the left and right. Contact with them hurts, but
                once you get Energy Form you can make quick work of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Jellyfish
Location:       Mithalas City (Ruins)
Tactics:        I've put this here for completionist purposes. This giant black
                jellyfish is totally invincible, even though it appears to take
                damage when you shoot it. Just ignore it, or play with it for a
                bit, but it's harmless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Eel
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        The Deep Eel moves around in the solid black of The Abyss,
                luring creatures into its jaws with it's angler light. It
                can move quite quickly, but it is rather weak and will die
                to a few energy blasts.
Spoils:         Glowing Egg - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Jellyfish
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        See Tiny Jellyfish
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Shrimp
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        See Shrimp. Note, these creatures give off light, like
                many Abyss denizens.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Urchin
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        This ball of spikes moves left and right, and is only
                vulnerable from underneath. Swim under it and fire to kill it,
                or just avoid it altogether.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepcrawlers
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        These strange creatures appear as large multicoloured grubs
                encased in a plastic bubble. As you shoot them, they will
                decrease in size until they eventually disappear into
                nothingness. Very odd beings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eel
Location:       Home Waters, The Kelp Forest, The Veil
Tactics:        These medium sized browny yellowy eels just swim around
                aimlessly. Shoot them down for some easy ingredients.
                Also worth mentioning is that they react to the Verse - if you
                sing, they will swim in position to the notes - for instance,
                if you sing Red, they will swim above you. Sing Green, they
                will swim below you. Make them circle you three times, and they
                will drop an Eel Oil.
Spoils:         Eel Oil - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Electric Eel
Location:       The Veil
Tactics:        Although these slightly thicker eels do indeed emit electricity
                now and then, they are totally harmless. Treat them like
                regular eels.
Spoils:         Eel Oil - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Electric Jellyfish
Location:       The Song Cave, The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        The golden Electric Jellyfish are not so tough. Stay away from
                them until you have the Energy Form, but from then on just
                blast them to bits from afar.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Energy Shrimp
Location:       The Energy Temple
Tactics:        These little white round-headed shrimp stick to walls, but
                when you come close, they leap at you, fire a blast of blue
                energy, then swim back to the nearest wall. Shoot them a few
                times, to get rid of them, but don't worry about them too much.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fish
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Not even nearly an enemy, but put here for completionist
                purposes. Shoals of various harmless fishies swim every ocean
                of Aquaria, and blasting them with the Energy Form makes them
                drop some goodies. Worth doing if you need ingredients!
Spoils:         Fish Meat - Common
                Fish Oil - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flatfish
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        I have no idea if these are fish or not, but they are flat
                looking blobs that sit in the sand, and when you come near they
                spring up before settling back down. Shoot them to bits to kill
                them, or just avoid them altogether. They can be hard to see in
                the sand, though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Froog
Location:       The Energy Temple
Tactics:        Simply blast them while avoiding their leaps. Couldn't be
                simpler.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gateway
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        This guy is actually just a test to make sure you know how to
                use your new form. In Dual Form, as Li, kill 3 enemies, then
                switch to Naija form (spin to change forms) and unleash a
                scream that will defeat this guy in one hit. Luckily, he
                continually spews out little black squid for you to kill!
                Isn't that thoughtful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Globe Crab
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        These crabs get special mention because they work differently.
                These pink crabs crawl around on the wall behind, often getting
                in your way. They are not offensive or aggressive, but they do
                hurt to touch. Simply avoid them or blast them out of the way.
Spoils:         Crab Meat - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grabbyarm
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        The Grabbyarm is, as it's name suggests, a big ol' grabby arm.
                In The Body, just it's tendrils stick out of the wall, but as
                you pass, it shoots out at a speed of 632mph. If you are
                grabbed, fire some Energy Blasts to get it to let you go.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ground Shocker
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        These pointy-shelled denizens of the extreme deep patrol back
                and forth along the wall, sending shockwaves as they go. Bind
                their shells off their backs, then proceed to blast them away.
Spoils:         Spicy Meat - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardbeetle
Location:       Open Waters, the map connected to Home Waters, near the Fish
                Tunnel in the north of the map.
Tactics:        This little squishy looking fellow crawls aimlessly around an
                odd rock formation. He hurts if you crash into him, and he
                flashes if you attack him, but he has no attacks and seemingly
                infinite HP. Odd!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horror
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        If the Scavenger is not the hardest regular enemy, these guys
                are. These half mutant, half crab zombie lobster things erupt
                from the ceiling and dangle there, shooting very fast, very
                accurate homing blasts at you. Together with the other denizens
                of The Body they can be quite deadly, so either swim past as
                quick as possible or pray your control mastery is top-notch.
                Several energy blasts will be required to dislodge them
                for good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horseshoe Crab
Location:       Open Waters, The Kelp Forest, The Veil
Tactics:        These little brown things kinda look like computer mice.
                They'll follow you, quite quickly, and as always,
                contact = damage. Just swim away as fast as possible, and blast
                them out of the sky. Er.. water. They come in packs, so watch
                out.
Spoils:         Rubbery Meat - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hydraworm
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        All this big orange worm does is swim towards you, so swim away
                while firing at his head to take him out.
Spoils:         Small Egg - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ice Jellyfish
Location:       Ice Cavern, The Frozen Veil
Tactics:        These are totally harmless, and look pretty to boot. I just
                let them live!
Spoils:         Jelly Oil - Rare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ice Shrimp
Location:       Ice Cavern, The Frozen Veil, Bubble Cave
Tactics:        See Shrimp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ice Otter
Location:       The Frozen Veil, Bubble Cave
Tactics:        These cute little guys carry an item in their paws. If you
                want it, sprint into them a few times (in any form other
                than Beast Form!!) and they will drop it! Killing them
                does not give you the item.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krill
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil, The Abyss
Tactics:        These little pill-bodies things are actually harmless,
                gameplay-wise anyway. They swim about, lay eggs on walls, then
                the eggs hatch, and they lay more eggs, etc. They do also die
                on their own, but they reproduce a lot faster than they die.
                This, eventually, can slow down your machine - just kill a
                bunch if you want but move on quickly if they are getting out
                of hand!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leech
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        These browny grey slugs hang out in the dark, and only attack
                when you swim past. Well, not really attack, they just hang on
                to your body and slow you down. When you have several slugs on
                you, Naija slows to a crawl! Roll around (move the mouse around
                Naija, or press the R key) to dislodge them!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leopard Shark
Location:       The Kelp Forest, The Veil
Tactics:        See Tiger Shark, only these are even less aggressive, and
                yellowy in colour.
Spoils:         Shark Fin - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lionfish
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        The Lionfish is pretty easy-going. It won't really attack
                you, but it will swim around a lot, and contact with it will
                hurt a lot and also poison you! You can take it down with many
                energy blasts, but make sure it doesn't bump into you!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loper
Location:       Mithalas City, Mithalas Cathedral
Tactics:        Looking kind of like floating grey helmets, with one central
                eye and a point on top, these beasties swim right and left on
                a straight line, firing groups of small pink homing darts at
                you. Simply swim around them, blasting them until they drop.
Spoils:         Glowing Egg - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mermog
Location:       Open Waters, The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        The Mermog come in 2 colours, and 2 styles. Green and purple,
                and walking and sitting. Walking Mermog will walk around the
                walls, and jump amazing distances to attempt to hit you. They
                take several hits to take down, so be careful! Sitting Mermog
                will spit at you, causing damage. Purple Mermog even add poison
                to all their attacks!
Spoils:         Plant Leaf - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moray Eel
Location:       Mithalas City (Ruins)
Tactics:        These guys sit in some of the half-smashed houses in the ruins,
                snapping at you as you pass by. Easy enough, stay out of
                snapping range, and unload some energy blasts. Job done.
Spoils:         Small Egg - Uncommon
                Eel Oil - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkey
Location:       The Veil
Tactics:        Get ready for the fight of your life. Start in Nature Form,
                fire a Thorn or two to help defend against the Monkey's
                barrage, before switching to Dual Form. I hope you have a
                charged up scream, because you'll need 3 or 4 of those to bring
                one of these down. No, just kidding, these are ambient tree
                hugging creatures that die in an energy shot or two.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metaray
Location:       The Veil
Tactics:        Another ambient creature, this red ray can be seen jumping
                around the bubbles above The Veil, or just swimming around the
                massive seas. Harmless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Money Squid
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Ah, the little One-Eyed Squid is one of the most common enemies
                you'll face. Each squid itself is pretty fragile, they simply
                home in on you to attack, and only take a shot or two to kill,
                but they will keep coming back as long as their nest is left
                whole. The nest is a squid-shaped rock attached to a nearby
                wall, and it will churn out squids every few seconds until
                destroyed. The nest takes several shots, and while you are
                destroying it make sure to take out any spawned squid before
                they hit you.
Spoils:         Small Eye - Common (Squid)
                Small Egg - Always (Nest)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mosshead
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        This guy likes to sit on the floor, looking like a normal
                moss-covered rock, but when you get too close, he raises his
                head and strikes! His tongue is the weak point, so lure him
                into attacking, then quickly back out of range and blast him.
                Repeat this several times to defeat him!
Spoils:         Leaf Poultice - Common
                Veggie Cake - Rare
                Veggie Soup - Rare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutant Jellyfish
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        These bright pink jellyfish may look harmless, and on their
                own, they are. Together with another of their kind, however,
                they regularly emit shocks linking them together. Anything
                caught in these shocks is in for a nasty.. shock.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutant - Slim
Location:       Mithalas City, Mithalas Cathedral
Tactics:        These green freaks may be a lot more agile than any enemies you
                have faced so far, but they are still not too bad. They can
                only attack you by touching you, so use your superior speed to
                swim around them, and unload a few blasts to send them packing.
                Ignore their guttural moans, and the fact they can cling and
                crawl along walls! Beware, however, for they often travel in
                packs. If one swims into a poisonous vent, they become
                Mutant - Fat, so read that for tactics.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutant - Fat
Location:       Mithalas City, Mithalas Cathedral
Tactics:        These show up normally, sometimes, but usually when a
                Mutant - Slim enters a poison vent. These guys are impervious
                to Energy Form, and will mindlessly swim around slowly.
                Sometimes they ram Naija when up close, sometimes they run
                away. However, they can be Bound with the Bind Song, and they
                will harmlessly drag along beside you. Use this if they are in
                your way.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutated Naija
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        The ultimate creation of The Creator, this dark, mutated
                Aquarian bares an eerie resemblance to our protagonist. They
                come in packs, like the Mithalan Mutants, but these guys throw
                circles of blades and take much more damage to put down.
                3 or 4 Li shots should do it, just be quick on your toes about
                avoiding them during the fight.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutileye
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        Just a regular run-of-the-mill basic one eyed spiky
                centipedefish. Blast it a few times, but they often come in
                packs!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutilus
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        The final form of the Nautilus, the Mutlius acts just like
                his cousins, except he has a gross face on his shell. Gross.
                Anyway, he does more damage, is faster and has more HP. Deal
                with him in the same way as the lesser ones, though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nautilus
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Not to be confused with their red brethren, and especially not
                with the big momma Nautilus Prime, the regular ol' Nautilus
                is not much of a threat. They swim at about the same speed as
                you, and when they get too close, they will glow for a second,
                then attempt to ram you. Simply keep moving while shooting back
                at them, and in a few blasts they will be gone.
Spoils:         Small Eye - Uncommon
                Rubbery Meat - Rare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nauplius
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        These tall one-eyed reedy squiddy looking things fire streams
                of slow homing energy blasts at you. They can't take much
                punishment, but they come in swarms, and soon the screen can
                get full of blasts! Either take them out quickly, or swim past
                them as soon as you can.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Newtblaster
Location:       The Energy Temple
Tactics:        This gecko clings to the back wall, firing slow blasts from his
                tails. Shoot him a few times, and he'll blend into the
                background and move, only to reappear in a new spot a few 
                moments later and resume firing. Chase him down and keep
                blasting to take him out.
Spoils:         Spicy Meat - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nudibranch
Location:       Home Waters, The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        These little pink sea slugs usually come protected by a little
                shell. Binding the shell removes it, allowing you to shoot the
                bright blue weak spot underneath. They have no attacks, but are
                worth killing for their spoils.
Spoils:         Leaf Poultice - Uncommon
                Healing Poultice - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oarfish
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        I think this guy is just for show, really. This big grey eel
                swims around, but even bumping into him is harmless. A few
                shots and he's down.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orbiter
Location:       The Kelp Forest, The Veil
Tactics:        I have no idea what, if any, real world sea creatures these are
                supposed to be. Little, 6-limbed floating heads, by the looks
                of it. Blue in colour, with yellow eyes and a pink spot that
                fires energy blasts at you, they'll swim close then attempt to
                circle you while firing. A few of your own energy blasts will
                quickly put it to rest.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parrot
Location:       The Veil
Tactics:        Read "Monkey". And bring lots of health food.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Piranha
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        The piranha, like their real life counterparts, stick together.
                Where there's one, there's probably four or five at least.
                When they see you they will swim towards you, attempting to
                bite you. Thankfully they cannot corner very well, and if you
                position yourself right, they will actually circle you
                indefinitely. Just shoot them while avoiding them, piece of
                cake.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pistol Shrimp
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        Ah, the Pistol Shrimp. One of the most amazing creatures in
                real life, it's Aquaria version is no exception! The Pistol
                Shrimp floats around, and when it sees you it will swim close,
                then fire a high-powered fast shot at you before rocketing
                away in the other direction! It will repeat this with
                surprising haste, so you must be agile to avoid it and blast
                it down before it does too much damage.
Spoils:         Spicy Meat - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plasmaworm
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        This fluorescent blue, multi-segmented worm sure look pretty
                swimming around, but offers no challenge as it is completely
                harmless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Porpoise
Location:       The Frozen Veil
Tactics:        No doubt you'll notice these cousins to the Dolphin swimming
                around when you enter the Frozen Veil. They drop nothing,
                and look super cool, so just leave them alone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predatory Tunicate
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        These big glowing blue things eat Naija if she gets too close.
                Blast them from the inside to get out. You can actually repeat
                this several times to kill them, but the damage to your own
                health is not worth it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puffer Fish
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        Just shoot it a few times and it'll die. Get too close and
                it'll puff up, and contact will cause damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raspberry
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        The Blue Raspberry crawls along the wall and fires energy
                blasts at you. These purple blasts are pretty slow, and have
                very wide homing arcs, so they are not too hard to avoid.
                3 or 4 energy blasts of your own will quickly sort them out.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Nautilus
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Same as the little white Nautilus, really, except these guys
                hurt more, are more accurate, and take more hits before going
                down. Take out the baby white ones first, then focus your fire
                on the reds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Turtle
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These guys are protected by a thick purple rock-like shell,
                which absorbs all energy shots fired at them. If you use the
                Bind Song, however, you strip them of their protection, and
                their blue flesh is exposed. A few well-aimed energy shots
                later, and you have one less turtle in the world. They are
                pretty harmless, though, so just swim past them if you aren't
                feeling mean.
Spoils:                Turtle Meat - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rockhead
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        Rockhead is a tiny armour plated fish that travels back and
                forth. It is not aggressive, but will hurt you on contact. As
                far as I can tell, they are impervious to all damage. Just
                avoid them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rot Worms
Location:       Mithalas Cathedral, Bubble Cave
Tactics:        These medium sized spiked Armored worms might be daunting at
                first glance, but they aren't so tough. They sneak in and out
                of the disgusting green holes in the background, and if you
                swim too close to a hole, chances are a worm will come out and
                attempt to ram you. Simply swim away, and blast them a few
                times to put them out of their misery.
                Also note the one in Bubble Cave does not have a holes, and
                will just follow you around if you get close.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rukh
Location:       The Veil
Tactics:        Not really an enemy, but if you leapfrog your way up to the
                very top of The Veil, you may find a Rukh's nest. Attacking
                the Rukh causes it to drop an egg and fly away!
Spoils:         Rukh Egg - Always
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scavenger
Location:       The Sunken City
Tactics:        One of the hardest to deal with regular enemies, the Scavenger
                is a pink/grey flying insect-like creature. It will fly (er..
                swim) around, and for a second it'll rear back, like a horse.
                At this point it will shriek and charge at you at break-neck
                speed. It takes quite a few blasts to put down, but by now you
                should be fast enough to dodge their attacks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scooter
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Round, blue weird snail/squid looking things that crawl along
                walls and leap from wall to wall when they see you, these guys
                are harmless. Shoot them to death if you want, otherwise, just
                ignore!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seahorse
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These guys are harmless and a lot of fun, but you can kill them
                in Beast Form if you really want to. It's much more fun to
                right click them to ride them, then control them with Naija's
                song!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seawolf
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        This guy just sits in his little hole in the wall until you
                swim past, at which point he will lunge out and try to eat you,
                causing a lot of damage! He is invincible, and you cannot even
                touch him with your energy blasts, so just ignore him and swim
                past quickly!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocker
Location:       The Energy Temple
Tactics:        This guy is odd. Big yellow head, looks kinda weird, but not
                hard to beat. He's actually harmless to touch, but emits a high
                powered shockwave from his head every 10 seconds or so. Blast
                him a few times to take him out, or just leave him alone. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shrimp
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These tiny little red guys are no threat to anyone, swimming
                around aimlessly. A few shots will take them out, but there's
                really no need for it!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skeeter
Location:       The Sun Temple
Tactics:        This clockwork pond skimmer skims across the top of the water
                inside The Sun Temple. Shoot him a few times to send cogs
                everywhere!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slender Eel
Location:       The Abyss, The Sunken City
Tactics:        See Eel
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snail Gear
Location:       The Sun Temple
Tactics:        Whaaat? Snails should not be fast!! This guy rockets around the
                walls, leaping between them like so many other enemies. Chase
                him down and blast him to bits.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spider Crab
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        These large purple crab things spin webs from their abdomens,
                leaving long trails wherever they go. If you touch this web
                you will slow down, so swim around it while firing at the pink
                spot on the back of the lobster to defeat it.
Spoils:         Spider Egg - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spikyball
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        These little brown spiky seeds bounce up and down quite high.
                They almost look cute with their little leaves on top, but
                contact with them is dangerous, and they take a few blasts to
                kill. Either avoid them, or stay out of range while firing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spiny Crab
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        These guys get a special mention. They act like regular Crabs,
                mainly, but they are much faster, come in groups, are
                invincible, and change direction when hit by a charged Sun
                shot. Just avoid them best you can. However, if you an lure
                one into a Predatory Tunicate, it will be devoured, and
                it's spoils released.
Spoils:         Spider Egg - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Splitter
Location:       Mithalas City (Ruins), Mithalas City, Mithalas Cathedral
Tactics:        Pink jellyfish type creatures with two blue nuclei and two
                flippers. They can only damage you on contact, so swim around
                them while shooting them. Upon death, they split into two
                smaller versions, each containing one nucleus - same tactics
                apply, though, shoot them while avoiding them until they
                explode into a gooey mess.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spookfish
Location:       The Sunken City
Tactics:        Incorporeal ghost fish (although you can bump into them).
                Ignore them, as you cannot do anything with them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spooter
Location:       Ice Cavern
Tactics:        See Spooter, except these do hurt when they touch you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Squiddy
Location:       Open Waters, The Veil
Tactics:        The Squid circles around you when it sees you, and fires ink at
                you. If the ink hits, your vision is severely impaired, making
                you an easy target for other predators, so be careful. The
                squid itself is pretty squishy, a few energy blasts will sort
                it out.
Spoils:         Rubbery Meat - Common
                Small Tentacle - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starmie
Location:       The Veil
Tactics:        These guys hang out in the background until you get close or
                fire at them, at which point they burst into the foreground and
                start spinning. They'll float around, and when in range they'll
                fire a star shaped blast at you. It's fast, so be ready to
                dodge! Blast them out of the water with a few quick blasts. One
                thing to keep in mind, though, is that each blast pushes the
                Starfish away - be ready to chase it or be on guard for it to
                re-appear with a blast of it's own!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Super Raspberry
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        Thankfully less common than their blue cousin, the Pink
                Super Raspberry shares the same lifestyle. Crawling along
                walls, firing energy blasts at you, only this time, the
                blasts are faster, home in better, and there are more of them.
                The creature itself can take more of a beating, too. Be careful
                with these, they can muck you up quickly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swordfish
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        The Swordfish looks like.. a swordfish. Or a sailfish. I get
                those two mixed up. Anyway, they act like the Nautilus, in that
                they swim close, then dart towards you rapidly. They can also
                dart from offscreen, so be careful.
Spoils:         Fish Meat - Common
                Swordfish Steak - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tabar
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These guys are little green bat-like things with two webbed
                wings. Or.. fins, I guess. They hang out at the top of caves,
                and when they see you or you fire at them, they shriek and dive
                down, before flying back up again. Contact with them hurts, so
                avoid them. Several blasts will reduce them to a pair of
                falling fins and nothing more.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiger Shark
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        These sharks patrol left and right, and only pay you any
                attention if you get really close, at which point they home
                in on you for a tasty snack. Just sit back and blast them to
                pieces.
Spoils:         Shark Fin - Uncommon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiny Jellyfish
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These tiny jellyfish do no harm at all, and look quite pretty.
                If you sing, they'll flock around you!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toad
Location:       Mithalas City (Ruins), Mithalas City
Tactics:        These little beady-eyed two-legged black toads will perch in
                various locations around Mithalas, firing blue energy blasts.
                These blasts ricochet a few times before dispersing, so when
                you see one fly off the screen; do not discount it for good.
                The blasts make a very distinct noise when bouncing, so be
                aware. Blast the toads, avoiding their large hops and blasts,
                until they croak. Metaphorically.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Triffle
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        These tiny little fluorescent stationary fish do no damage, and
                provide light. One or two energy blasts will still kill them,
                however.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trillious
Location:       The Energy Temple
Tactics:        This pink jellyfish thing is harmless to the touch, in fact,
                you pass right through it. However, it does leave poisonous
                clouds where it passes, which will indeed damage you. Your new
                Energy Form can take it out, no problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tromulo
Location:       Everywhere
Tactics:        These blue/purple floating octopi can be a pain. Once you shoot
                them, they start to swell up, and after several shots they will
                explode into a circle of energy blasts. The blasts are easy to
                avoid, as long as you are far enough away.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turret
Location:       The Energy Temple
Tactics:        These iridescent eyes sit on the walls, firing energy blasts
                blindly. A few of your own blasts soon take them out.
Spoils:         Fish Meat - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turtle
Location:       The Veil, Bubble Cave
Tactics:        Don't kill these guys! They are defenceless and harmless. And..
                your game crashes if you kill them. Yeah.
Spoils:         A nasty virus on your computer, don't do it!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virus Pod
Location:       The Body
Tactics:        The Virus Pod is a big green sphere with tentacles. It rotates,
                then fires 4 diagonal very poisonous spines. They are slow and
                stupid, but they often fill up a room and it can be very hard
                to avoid that many spines. Proceed with caution, and take your
                time making sure you kill them all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wisker
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Tactics:        These little blue guys have spiky plants growing from their
                backs, the most prominent of which, the three pink spikes, they
                will fire at you at set intervals. The spikes do have homing
                capabilities, so be careful. Just make sure you stay between
                the spikes, and blast them off the walls from afar.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wisp
Location:       The Abyss
Tactics:        These little white fish are harmless, but they do provide
                light. It is actually possibly to trap one of these in a Fish
                Form bubble, then Bind it to give yourself a kind of ghetto
                light source in The Abyss. Much easier to just get Sun Form or
                Dumbo, though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whelk
Location:       Open Waters
Tactics:        Like the Nudibranch, these are harmless cuties. If you want
                to kill them, you evil fiend, you need to Bind their shells off
                of their backs first.
Spoils:         Leaf Poultice - Rare

Here's a list of the main storyline bosses you will face on your adventure.
Included are hints for how to beat them, and also a straightforward guide in
case my hints are not enough.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Fallen God
Location:       Energy Temple
Required Forms: Energy
Attacks:        Let's Get Physical - When you are within range, it occasionally
                lunges and bites at you.
                Let's Get Physical 2 - More often than not, however, it will
                simply reel back then swipe at you. Dodge backwards to avoid
                it.
                Energy Blasts - It also fires 3 slow non-homing energy blasts
                at you when you are out of melee range.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          Flashing yellow doesn't mean he's taking damage, however it
                does make him move back. Maybe he's guarding something?
                Force fields don't just hurt you.
Guide:          This fight contains two parts. The first part requires you to
                blast the God as much as possible to make him move back. This
                reveals a pearl he was guarding. When the God is far enough
                back, switch to song form and Bind the pearl. Take it far to
                the right to find a socket for it. Once it is in it's socket,
                change back to energy form. Now comes the second part of the
                fight. Move to wherever the God is, he should still be at the
                back firing energy balls at you. Get close enough to him so
                that he swipes for you, then dart back to the right. After
                swiping he'll crawl towards you. Repeat this all the way up
                to the pearl, then blast the pearl (right-click to charge,
                move the mouse over the pearl then fire). This will activate a
                force field that will shock the boss if he is in contact with
                it. Doing this will move him back and damage him, forcing you
                to lure him into it a second time. Once you have done it two
                times, he wises up and stops just short of the force field when
                you try to lure him. To hit him this one final time, you need
                to move close, get him to swipe at you, then activate the
                force field while his arm is in range of it. This will shock
                him a 3rd and final time, killing him for good.
Rewards:        A vision, a treasure, and a way out of the temple.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mithalan God
Location:       Mithalas Cathedral
Required Forms: Energy
Attacks:        This Sucks - He reels back, opens that big ol' mouth of his,
                and sucks. You can try to fight the current, but it's strong,
                and if he eats you, you take damage before swimming out again.
                Yuck.
                Energy Blasts - Like nearly every sea creature, the Mithalan
                God has the magical power of Energy Blasts! He fires several
                slow moving blue blasts out of his mouth that home in with a
                wide arc.
                Energy Blasts: Super Pissed Off Edition - Once you damage him
                enough, he'll go bright red and get really mad. Even the
                background music gets mad. Man. Anyway, his Energy Blasts will
                be replaced by their bright red, super fast cousins. Shield
                will no longer deflect these, so just try to avoid them.
                Let There Be Life! - Like all good Gods, this one can create
                life. Unfortunately, he can only seem to create slim mutants.
                Oh well.
                Grabaroo - Once raging, hiding between the poison vents will
                just cause the God to pick you up and eat you. Bad times.
Critical Mode:  He glows red, the music changes, and he starts spamming
                non-deflectable energy blasts. Good luck!
Hints:          If he's so damn hungry, give him something to eat!
                Don't forget, you aren't stuck in Energy Form.
                He's a big guy; he probably won't be interested in your food.
                More likely he'll be interested in you.
                Or at least something the same size as you.
                Maybe something swollen and green and poisonous and gross.
                He needs to be in his kitchen to eat. At the back of his cave.
                How to get him back there? When you shoot him, he goes yellow.
                Remember the last boss that went yellow when you shot him?
                Okay, now he's pissed, and flashes red when I shoot him.
                Red? That's a good colour. Keep doing that.
Guide:          The first boss that really gives people a hard time, and for
                good reason. Naija even suggests exploring elsewhere before
                confronting him! Once you have mastered the controls, however,
                he is not impossible.
                Begin by shooting him back as far as he will go, then switching
                to normal form, binding one of the fatty poison mutants
                hovering around, and drag it towards him. Let it go, then
                return to Energy Form, and open fire. When he is as far back as
                he will go; he will use his Suck attack, and eat the poisonous
                mutant - causing damage.
                This must be repeated three times. If you need more mutants,
                let him walk forward as far as he'll go, and eventually he'll
                create more. Lure them into the poison vents to transform them,
                and repeat. Remember, he'll only create mutants at the front of
                the platform, and only suck at the back of it. Use the shield
                to deflect the energy blasts.
                Once repeated three times, the God's eye will fall out, he'll
                go red, and the music will change. At this point, just switch
                to Energy Form and go nuts. Blasts will damage him, and he'll
                stop using his Suck and Create attacks, replacing them both
                with upgraded Energy Blasts. Dodge the blasts as best you can,
                and don't be afraid to scoff yourself with food halfway through
                the fight. A large supply of healing poultices, along with some
                Veggie Soups for their regeneration, are suggested. Once you
                have blasted his face enough, he'll keel over and die.
                Poor guy.
Rewards:        Beast Form.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Drunian God
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Required Forms: Energy
Attacks:        Seeds! - The Drunian God can spawn multiple Spikyballs from her
                face, which then proceed to bounce around the room, swept
                around by the currents. These disappear on their own if you
                wait a little while.
                Worms! - She calls forth spiky one-eyed worms from the walls.
                These proceed to circle you. Shoot them in the eye multiple
                times to deal with them. After a few moments, however, they
                disappear on their own.
                Shock! - When you sing to her, she gets so surprised that a
                circle of energy blasts shoot out of her face. Just position
                yourself far enough away that you can avoid these.
Critical Mode:  She goes red, opens her eyes continuously, and 3 large 
                Spikyballs circle her, acting as a shield. She also continually
                summons un-Shield-able energy blasts and worms. Keep firing!!
Hints:          Looks like she's really just a big face. Probably have to
                damage that, then.
                Attacks don't seem to work! Just relax.
                She's not the only one that can sing.
                She looks surprised! Now's your chance!
                Like all bosses in every game, rinse and repeat.
                Uh-oh, now she's pissed. End the fight quickly!
Guide:          Not too hard, nothing compared to the Mithalan God, anyway.
                Start by dodging her Seeds! and Worms! attack. When she sings
                a single note, sing it back to her. She'll use Shock!, but you
                can even deflect a shot or two back at her with Shield if you
                are good. Once her eyes are open, blast her with Energy Form
                until she closes them again. Rinse and repeat this part several
                times, she'll summon more Spikyballs and Worms each time,
                however.
                Eventually she will go red, at this point stay in Energy Form
                and blast her to your hearts content, avoiding the multiple
                high-powered energy blasts and worms she summons. Several
                hundred energy blasts later, she's toast!
Reward:         Nature Form

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Sun God
Location:       The Sun Temple
Required Forms: Energy, Beast, Nature
Attacks:        This both Sucks, and Blows - The Sun God can change the level
                of the water in his chamber at will, and while doing so will
                either try to bite you himself, or blow you into one of the
                dangerous spiky balls in the room. If positioned correctly, he
                can even blow you out of the broken window in the ceiling,
                forcing you to climb back through the entire temple to try
                again.
                Chew - The Sun God is constantly chewing, if you get bit it
                hurts. A lot.
Critical Mode:  The Sun God moves around faster, and fires off a constant
                stream of energy blasts.
Hints:          Simplest boss in the game, really. Maybe if you shoot him???
Guide:          Just because it's simple doesn't mean it's easy. This boss will
                require lots of quick thinking and health items, so bring a
                plentiful supply of both. At the start, you only have to deal
                with the Sun God's ability to change the water depth - sucking
                it in, which can cause damage if you touch him, and blowing it
                out, which can cause damage if you touch a spiky ball. Also
                worth noting: if you get blown or jump out of the ceiling, you
                will fall to The Veil and have to climb all the way back up to
                re-attempt this boss.
                Once you get him damaged, he'll go Critical, and start firing
                energy at you. Basically continue the same routine, avoiding
                everything at all costs, and chomping on poultices and cakes
                whenever you need to. There's not much strategy to this
                boss - just evade, stick to the walls whenever you can, and
                keep shooting him. Bringing some Energy Shot + food wouldn't
                go amiss, either. Good luck.
Rewards:        Sun Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Golem
Location:       The Sunken City
Required Forms: Energy, Beast, Light
Attacks:        Charge! - The Golem puts it's hammer arms out in front of it
                and rams you at high speed. Swim over the top of him.
                Body Slam - The Golem leaps and attempts to smash you. Dart
                under him.
                Energy Bolts - When the Priest goes on the offensive she fires
                energy bolts at you. Just keep moving to avoid them.
Critical Mode:  The Priest starts firing energy bolts at you and the Golem
                attacks much faster and non-stop.
Hints:          The Golem is invincible. It seems the Priest is helping it.
                Those little Jellyfish are immune to fire. Jellyfish taste
                nice, though. Yum.
                Defeat one with what the other provides.
Guide:          It may take a few tries to get used to the pattern of this
                boss, but once you manage it he's not too bad.
                Begin by dodging three of his attacks, either swimming over him
                when he charges or darting under him when he jumps. After
                dodging three times, the Priest will swim up to his face and
                pat him on the head, releasing a small purple jellyfish. Switch
                to Beast Form and charge it to eat it. Dodge another three
                attacks, but this time when the Priest swims up to pat the
                Golem, shoot her with Beast form's right-click. The Golem will
                get kinda mad and start attacking you pretty fast, switch to
                Energy Form and blast him to pieces while dodging his attacks.
                After a short while, the Priest will wake up and you'll need
                to repeat the process.
                Eventually the Golem will go red and be permanently vulnerable
                to your Energy shots, so keep smashing that right click button
                and dodge his even faster attacks. Keep in mind the Priest will
                also join in now and attempt to shoot you down. Energy Shot
                +damage foods are your friend here!
                Once the Golem takes enough damage, it dies and the fight
                is over.
Rewards:        Loneliness.

Boss:           The Creator MKI
Location:       The Body
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Creation - The Creator lives up to his name and creates either
                evil Pink Jellyfish, or a Mutilus.
                Energy Storm - The Creator raises one hand and fires countless
                energy bolts from it. I found the easiest way to dodge this is
                to just sit in a corner near him. You do get hit a bit but not
                nearly as much as if you swim around.
Hints:          Not much strategy to this guy.
Guide:          Simply blast his face while avoiding or killing the enemies.
                When he casts his energy storm sit tight and wait for it to
                end before swimming around again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator MKII
Location:       The Body
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Face Laser - The Creator emits a giant laser from his face
                which cuts up whichever wall he is facing. He does turn around
                when you swim over him, but if you time it right you can dodge
                the attack.
                Poison Balls - The Creator fires several ugly red homing balls
                of poison at you. They do contact damage AND poison you, and
                they are rather hard to avoid so I hope you stocked up on
                items before coming in.
                Grab - If you are level with his arms he will try and grab you,
                and you will continually take damage until you spin yourself
                free. This is incredibly difficult to get out of sometimes, so
                try not to get caught by it.
Hints:          Another straightforward fight. Blast his face off! Uh.. what's
                left of it!
Guide:          A straight slogging fight. Use any Energy Shot+ foods you may
                have, and cure yourself whenever you get poisoned. This is
                near the end, so do not be worried about using your items!
                Good luck!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator..!? MKIII
Location:       The Body
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Bite - When in front of his giant pincers he will jab forward
                and try to bite you.
                Ram - When hurt (or just randomly sometimes if he feels like
                it) he will try to ram past you. Kinda hard to dodge as he's
                so big and fast.
Hints:          Now you have him on the retreat! Chase him down.
                Like all one eyed bosses, his eye is probably the weak point.
                Trouble is, how do you make him put his guard down?
Guide:          Now he's running away, pfft. Chase him through the
                progressively darkening tunnel, switching to Sun Form near
                the end. When you enter the big three-circle area, slowly drift
                around blasting sunlight around. When you find the boss,
                approach him in Energy Form and repeatedly strike him. He'll
                open his pincers to lunge at you, and hopefully a blast will
                hit him in the eye. At this point he will charge past you so
                cling to a wall, then switch back to Sun Form and track him
                down again. Rinse and repeat. After a few blasts he'll retreat
                to the small room to the right (Look on your map). Follow him
                there and blast him one or two more times as per normal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator MKIV
Location:       The Body (I wanna say something cool like The Heart but no
                official names are given!)
Required Forms: None
Attacks:        Song - The Creator can sing just like you! Whichever notes he
                sings come to life and track you down. They move slowly, so
                simply swim around them.
Hints:          It doesn't look like he takes any damage from your attacks.
                I guess there is nothing left to do but sing!
Guide:          It's a simple Simon Says battle. He sings three notes, they
                come after you, and you must sing the same notes while dodging
                them. You don't need to sing them all in a row, but you do need
                to sing them in order. If you sing all three without getting
                hit by any of them, he takes damage. If not, you take damage.
                Repeat this several times. If your reaction time is actually
                short enough, you can just hover directly over the Creator and
                sing the notes as soon as they appear, meaning you don't need
                to swim about, dodging them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           The Creator
Location:       Nowhere
Required Forms: All
Attacks:        Energy Blasts - The Creator can summon huge homing energy
                blasts from his hand and from his mouth, at least for the first
                part of the battle. Dodge them and let them arc around you
                before dodging again.
                Creation - He can create a single Mutant Naija enemy from his
                hand. Take it out when it shows up to stop it annoying you.
                Creation2 - When you damage his chest cavity in the 2nd half of
                the fight, he summons a few Mutilus for you to charge up on.
                Thanks, God!
                Destruction - Hey, he can do both! For the latter part of this
                battle his chest cavity fires this incredibly potent laser at
                you periodically. It's very easy to avoid if you don't go
                anywhere near it, unfortunately it fires from his weak point.
                The screen goes dark blue for a few seconds before he fires
                this, so you have been warned.
Hints:          1st part: His face worked on the last few forms, try it again!
                          Hmm, his eye is poking out but it's still attached.
                          It looks pretty dark. Dark. Dark!
                          Right, now that doesn't work either, but it doesn't
                          look like it's attached anymore. If only I could
                          pull it out!
                2nd part: Right, well he's majorly pissed off now. What's that
                          in his chest-mouth micro-seconds before he fires?
                          Hm, doesn't seem to take damage from Energy Form.
                          Well, Li's back now, maybe he can think of something?
                          Ok, that seems to hurt him, but it looks like he
                          could go on like this all day. If only I had an even
                          MORE potent attack!
Guide:          1st part: Jeez. Ok, time to show him what we've learned! Switch
                          to Energy Form. Blast his face to pieces while
                          avoiding the energy blasts and killing any enemies he
                          summons. Soon enough, his faceguard will shatter
                          and.. ew, his eye pops out! Switch to Sun Form. Throw
                          a fully charged sunbeam in his eye and.. it shines.
                          Blast it to shreds with Energy Form! If the eye stops
                          shining before you damage it enough, repeat the
                          sunbeam/energy form combo until it goes black. At
                          which point, switch to neutral/song form and Bind it!
                          Get out of the way, quick!
                2nd part: Li is back! We're in business. He stops firing blasts
                          from his mouth, however he does keep firing them from
                          his hand. Switch to Dual Form and head south.
                          Yuck! What the hell is that? Charge up a Li blast.
                          Wait for it... wait for it... the screen goes dark
                          blue, the mouth starts opening, fire! Make sure you
                          get out of the way, quickly. You need to fire the
                          second the head inside his mouth is visible, and then
                          dart directly up or down. I find it easier to use the
                          keyboard for this. If you DO get hit, well, I hope
                          you have a ton of healing stuff left over. Once you
                          smash the head in his mouth with a Li blast, he
                          releases some handy Nautilus for you to absorb. Kill
                          them with Li blasts while avoiding the Energy Blast
                          attacks of the Creator, and when you've killed three
                          switch to Naija Form. Swim up to the Creator's head
                          and let rip! The Creator won't be too happy with
                          that. Switch back to Li Form and repeat this all
                          twice more. Good luck!
Rewards:                  End Sequence.
                          It's done! You actually beat Aquaria, for real!
                          Congrats. Did you get all the secrets? If not, get
                          back out there!
                          Happy swimming!

These guys are all the bosses you don't have to fight, but might want to for
the rewards. Like the boss guides, hints are provided before an actual guide.
Good luck!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Nautilus Prime
Location:       Home Waters
Attacks:        Spinning Around - Like all Nautilus, it constantly spins
                around. This is more of a key point of the Prime Nautilus
                however, as it's weak point is only in line with you for a
                short time.
                Spawn! - It can spawn a bunch of baby Nautilus and will
                continue to do so throughout the fight.
                Charge! - Also like all Nautilus, when it gets within range of
                you it stops for a second then charges at you at full speed.
                Energy Bolts - It fires several small purple homing energy
                bolts at you regularly throughout the fight.
Critical Mode:  Once it goes red, it swims much faster and fires many, many
                more energy bolts.
                It also appears to spawn less babies, but they are still there.
Hints:          If you don't have anything to shoot him with, you're going to
                have a hard time.
Guide:          It's a good idea to wait until you have the Energy Form to do
                this thing, but apparently it is possible with rocks. You'd
                need to be insanely good, though. Anyway, once you have Energy
                Form and a lot of courage, go into its area. To make the fight
                a lot easier, switch to song form and pick up the rock near the
                entrance. You can keep this bound even in Energy Form and it
                makes the fight a lot smoother. So, with rock in tow, go near
                this big mama and lock onto it. Fire a blast into its face and
                the fight will begin!
                Swim around it in either direction, and keep charging up
                blasts. Release them when you are sure they will hit its face
                rather than its shell, any blasts that hit its shell are
                wasted. Half the blasts will still probably hit the smaller
                Nautilus, but that doesn't matter. The rock you are towing will
                keep the smaller Nautilus from attacking you, and will even
                deflect the Nautilus Prime if it happens to charge into the
                rock rather than you! Once you hit it enough it will go red
                and start firing a lot more energy bolts at you. Don't be put
                off, just keep swimming in circles around it and firing bolts
                at its face until it gives up! Keep in mind the blue jellyfish
                around the bottom of the area. If you do need a quick health
                boost, charge down to them and destroy them quickly. This is a
                bit risky, however, and it's much safer to just cure with food
                items.
Rewards:        Baby Nautilus Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mergog
Location:       Mermog Cave
Attacks:        Super Blasts - Mergog will sit in his little cubbyhole in the
                far right of the cave, and launch a seemingly endless barrage
                of blasts at you. They do not corner well, use this to your
                advantage and sit in one of the little dips near the vines to
                the south.
                Chargin' Mah.. you get it - Mergog charges a laser, then fires
                it while moving around. Stay really low to the ground to avoid
                this, as he cannot fire it that low.
Critical Mode:  None, as far as I'm aware.
Hints:          His attacks may look scary, but they are easy to dodge.
                Just keep shooting!
Guide:          Not hard at all, very possible to do it without even getting
                hit. If you just sit in a little area between two vines on the
                bottom floor and keep spamming energy blasts, he'll be dead in
                no time at all, and both his attacks will miss you completely.
                He may ram you, so be careful of that, but even that is very
                unlikely.
Rewards:        Piranha Egg
                Special Bulb
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Blaster Peg Prime
Location:       Energy Temple - Secret Room
Attacks:        Blast - The Blaster Peg will roam around the room, and when
                close will fire many many blaster shots at you. Just dodge
                them.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          If only you had something to shoot him with.. oh, wait.
Guide:          As you enter the room, proceed slowly, and shoot any little
                Blaster Pegs you find. When you get far enough into the room,
                the door will close, a laugh will sound and the Prime will
                attack. 
                Pretty straightforward boss, just keep shooting him until he
                croaks. Use some healing items, or some Energy Shot + items,
                if you want.
Reward:         Blaster Peg Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Octopus Prime
Location:       Octopus Cave (The Veil)
Attacks:        Overcompensation - The Octopus vomits 3 huge homing energy
                blasts, however they do not corner well, and if you sit in the
                area above the Octopus they will all miss you.
                Abomination - The Octopus will spawn a regular squid. Surely
                that shouldn't happen!
                Excess Ink - The Octopus will shoot ink, darkening the entire
                arena.
                Grab - When you get too close to the beak, the Octopus will
                swing it's arm down in an attempt to grab you.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          I'm not doing any damage! I need a weak spot.
                I can't see! How did I manage to see in the cave on the way
                here?
                Just before he tries to grab me, something shows up, just
                for a second..
Guide:          Not too bad once you get the pattern down. To start with, wait
                above him (but not too close) until he's just done an energy
                blast attack, then swim down in front of his face. This'll
                cause an audio cue, along with him reaching his arm back to
                swing, and his weak point, a pink orb, showing in his beak.
                Shoot this orb while swimming backwards out of the range of the
                arm. You can only get in two or three shots per time, but if
                you can repeat it quickly enough, he will very rarely use any
                other attacks.
                Obviously, switch to Sun Form and charge a right click blast
                when he uses his ink attack,  and shoot down any squid he
                spawns.
                Continue blasting his weak point, healing when necessary,
                to finish him off.
Reward:         Dumbo Octopus Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mithalan Priests
Location:       Mithalas Cathedral
Required Forms: Energy, Nature, Beast
Attacks:        Goin' Incorporeal - When not attacking, these guy's enter the
                spirit world where you cannot attack them.
                Energy Blasts - More often than not, however, they become solid
                so they can fire streams of homing energy blasts at you.
Critical Mode:  None.
Hints:          Not much to this boss, really. Circle and fire, circle
                and fire.
Guide:          So once you enter the middle of this room, the three Spirit
                Priests will appear and begin circling you. Switch to
                Energy Form.
                Don't bother locking on, just swim around in circles and hammer
                the right mouse button! Your shots only count when the Priests
                are corporeal, but as this is impossible to predict it's safer
                to fire blasts non-stop.
                When the Priests attack, the room will pretty quickly fill with
                energy blasts. It isn't easy to avoid these, but you can corner
                faster than the blasts can so if you are swimming in circles
                away from them it isn't too hard.
                Sooner or later one priest will go down, at which point the
                fight is even easier. Just keep right clicking and pretty soon
                the other two will subside too.
Rewards:        Spirit Form.

Boss:           Crabbius Maximus
Location:       Arnassi Ruins
Attacks:        Blubbles - Just kidding, they're actually just energy blasts.
                Three, large pink balls, moderate homing capabilities.
                Alley-oop - Once his arms are gone, Mr Maximus will leap into
                the air on occasion. Please try not to be above him when that
                happens.
Hints:          The only bits not under 20ft of armour seem to be his eyes!
                Wow, glowing red marks on his arms! That's subtle.
                Okay, so he's 'armless. Now what?
                I tell you, when he jumps over me, that's one ugly target on
                his backside.
Guide:          A pretty straight forward, and, dare I say it, fun battle!
                Start by getting used to the width of the area. When he stops
                to launch some blasts at you, shoot some of your own at his
                eyestalks while avoiding them. They'll flash red, and once you
                hit one several times, the crab will collapse, revealing the
                red spots on his arms. Target one and fill it full of energy,
                until it explodes. Repeat for the second arm.
                Okay, so now he's armless, time to focus on that strange
                octopus thing on his butt. Sprint-swim over the top of him,
                he'll bend down and jump above you. Release a fully charged
                energy blast as he's above you, and the shots should home in
                on his butt and do some damage. Repeat this a few more times,
                making sure to not get hit when he jumps up, and he's soon
                toast. You can also use Nature Form's thorns to accomplish
                this, but where's the fun in that?!
Reward:         Crab Armour
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           Mantis Shrimp Prime
Location:       Bubble Caves
Attacks:        Explosives - The Shrimp launches several of these slow moving
                explosive devices at you from his perch on the ceiling. When
                they come into contact with you or a wall they explode and
                release a circle of small yellow energy bolts.
Hints:          He looks pretty comfy on his bit of land there. If only there
                was some way of turning nature against him?
                Those bombs look nasty. Much more damaging than anything you
                can fire at him!
Guide:          Pretty easy when you know how, but you'll probably still take
                a bunch of damage, so come prepared.
                Begin by binding one of his bombs as he fires them at you.
                It'll trail behind you and slowly get redder until it
                explodes! Before that happens, quickly switch to nature form.
                Fire a Thorn (right-click charge) at his position and it'll
                knock him off his perch into the bubble you are in. Get out
                of the way! Once he's stuck there, either swim around him in
                circles until the bomb explodes (if you are far enough away
                you can easily dodge the bolts) or if you have time, switch
                to normal form and unbind the bomb. Either way, if it explodes
                near him it damages him.
                Once this is done, he'll shriek out and jump to the ceiling
                again. Simply repeat this twice more to get your (hopefully)
                final health upgrade!
Rewards:        Verse Egg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss:           King Jellyfish God Prime
Location:       The Abyss
Attacks:        Life! - The Jellyfish creates several little tiny pink
                jellyfish, which follow you around. They hurt on impact, and
                also shunt you out of the way.
                Death! - The Jellyfish glows in three point around it's eye,
                and a second later electric will shoot out of these points.
                They will then spin either clockwise or anti-clockwise for a
                few seconds, before changing direction. They then disappear.
Hints:          His eye. HIS EYE.
                It looks protected, apart from that one little gap.
                GOD DAMMIT THIS IS TOO HARD!!
Guide:          This guy is actually held by many as harder than the final
                boss. He can be,  depending on your play style. However, with a
                few healing items and a few tricks, he is not too bad. Begin by
                swimming up into his room, the camera will swoop over to his
                eye and he'll ominously begin lowering. If you came in by
                accident, this is your cue to leave, otherwise.. switch to
                Energy Form. He can only be damaged by shots to the unguarded
                part of his eye - a shield spins around his eye, so basically
                just keep shooting while swimming around him and hope some
                shots get through. The Baby Blaster Peg pet and Li are highly
                recommended for this fight. He'll start by summoning 3 or 4
                baby jellyfish, which will follow you around. Ignore them for
                now, and pound away at his eye. Soon, some spots will glow.
                Change to Beast Form, and avoid the lightning that blasts from
                these spots, while eating as many tiny jellyfish as possible to
                keep their numbers down. Eventually, this fight becomes a
                spamming-energy-blasts-while-chomping-on-food-items fight, as
                he starts summoning 6-10 jellyfish at a time. Keep piling the
                damage on his eye, though, and he'll go down in the end. Keep
                in mind, keys 1-8 change form. I didn't know this the first
                time, so it is doable by singing, but it was 150% harder.

Boss:           Simon Says
Location:       Arnassi Ruins
Attacks:        Simon Says - Read the guide.
Hints:          No hints here, I'm afraid!
Guide:          I hope you know what Simon Says is. Basically, this weird
                creature has one large eye in the centre, and 8 small orbs
                around it, one for each note you can sing. When you right click
                him, the "fight" begins. He'll sing a note by blinking one of
                the coloured orbs. You need to repeat said note, quickly.
                He'll then repeat the first note, and add a second. You need
                to then play these two notes. He and you will then take turns,
                up until he is singing 8 notes in a row. Get one wrong, or
                take too long, and he will roar and you'll need to right click
                him to start all over again.
                There's not much I can do to help here, you need quick
                reactions and honestly a bit of luck in which notes he picks.
                Just try, try and try again, and soon that cooking slot will
                be yours.
                Note: For beating him a second time, I got a Hand Roll. Haha.
Rewards:        Third Cooking Slot

| MINIBOSSES | #AQBOSSGMB
\------------/
These guys are too easy to be real bosses, but too rare, difficult or just
strange to be classed as regular enemies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bigmouth
Location:       The Kelp Forest, near the Verse Egg
Description:    An ugly bloated blue fish with three eyes.
Attacks:        Vacuum - Every few seconds, it'll open it's mouth and literally
                vacuum in every fish in the vicinity, including you if you
                aren't careful!
Tactics:        Just shoot him. Cling to walls to avoid the vacuum. You can
                actually shoot the tongue-replacing Isopod out of it's mouth
                with a few carefully aimed blasts - the Bigmouth will then swim
                around aimlessly. Alternatively, you can shoot the Bigmouth
                down, releasing the Isopod to kill afterwards.
Rewards:        Buttery Sea Loaf - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ekkit
Location:       Open Waters, just outside Mithalas City (Ruins)
Description:    Big, unique, silver fish, with two large jaws and odd fins.
                It's pretty bizarre, you'll know it when you see it.
Attacks:        None.
Tactics:        Just shoot it a lot.. if you want to kill it. You don't get
                anything for killing it, though. However, if you cling on to
                the creature by sprinting into it, it will take you through
                the currents to the other side.. where it'll most likely get
                killed by the plethora of enemies. Poor guy.   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Energy Statue
Location:       Energy Temple
Attacks:        Energy Bolts - When you hurt it, it fires energy bolts at you.
                The more you damage it, the more bolts it fires.
Tactics:        First up, cast shield. Check your menu if you forgot how to
                sing it. Second, wait for the little energy bolt thing to sing,
                then repeat the note he does. Hold it for a second or two and
                it'll get annoyed and try to blast you. This is where shield
                comes in handy, you reflect the bolts! Try blowing up the 4
                energy crystals around the edge of the room with reflected
                bolts for fun. After several rounds of repeating the energy
                bolt's notes, it'll die and the statue itself will sing a
                song. Repeat this song to end the encounter!
Rewards:        Energy Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great White
Location:       The Veil
Description:    Surprisingly, looks like a Great White! Shark, that is.
Attacks:        Bite - It can bite you.
                Lunge - It can lunge for you, too. So it can bite you.
Tactics:        Just swim away while firing energy blasts at it, eventually
                it'll die. The bite packs a whallop though, so be careful.
Rewards:        Shark Fin - Common
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grouper
Location:       Home Waters, south of Naija's house
Description:    Giant grey dopey looking fish.
Attacks:        None.
Tactics:        This guy is a pain, if any ingredients are dropped in the area,
                Gulper will come and eat them all up! He's harmless to you, but
                fill him with energy blasts for a little while and he'll
                trouble you no longer.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Octopus
Location:       Home Waters, The Veil
Description:    Upon first sight, the Octopus blends into the background, but
                when you go near his domain, southeast of Naija's home, he'll
                pop into view, choking a gasp from Naija. Once you see him,
                though, he's just a normal medium sized red octopus.
Attacks:        Ram - Touching him hurts, duh.
                Ink - He shoots ink at you, lowering your sight drastically.
                Swim around for a while until it wears off.
Tactics:        Once you get good with Energy Form this guy is no problem,
                just swim around blasting him. If he manages to leave the
                screen, he'll hide in the background again, so keep your eyes
                peeled.
Rewards:        Multiple Rubbery Meat + Small Tentacle - Always 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rotted Core
Location:       Mithalas Cathedral
Description:    Large, pink/red blob with 6 blue eyes around the edge of it's
                body.
Attacks:        Collision - Touching the Core will hurt you.
                Laser Vision - When an eye is shot, it will turn red and fire
                a laser straight out from it. Do not touch!
                Laser Disco - When you shoot all 6 eyes in turn, the Core will
                pivot on the spot. Stay between two lasers and spin with it to
                avoid damage.
                Corelings - When the Core starts to take damage, it will spawn
                some babies that home in on you - a few blasts will sort them
                out. However, if you do not take them out quickly, they will
                evolve an eye and eventually legs, too - each evolution will
                cause them to fire more and more pink blasts at you, which
                vaguely home in.
                Spin - Eventually, the lasers will stop, but the Core will move
                around the room, spinning, occasionally firing a lone laser.
Tactics:        Swim around the Core, shooting each eye in turn. Avoid it's
                Laser Disco attack, and as soon as the weak spot appears, a
                disgusting growth that extends from the creature's mouth, blast
                it to pieces! Continue blasting it until the creature dies,
                avoiding any further attacks and any Corelings it may spawn.
Rewards:        Game continuation 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Dragon
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Description:    Looks like a giant, plant-covered seahorse. You'll know it's
                near when you see the yellow energy blasts, hear the shriek or
                see the screen shake.
Attacks:        Energy Blasts - It also fires several yellow medium-speed
                energy blasts from it's face. Avoid these, they do not home
                in so it is not too hard.
Tactics:        The Sea Dragon is quite a pain to fight, so I often skip it.
                You meet them in a few spots around The Kelp Forest, and they
                respawn just like any other enemy. They take tons of damage to
                put down, and their blasts hurt if you do get caught by one.
                The only way to fight it, if you really want to, is to just
                follow it around, carefully swimming around it's blasts, firing
                shots of your own at it whenever it's on screen. However, if
                you do find yourself close to the beast, then sprint towards it
                (double click or space bar) and Naija might grip on - allowing
                you tons of free hits while it's blasts keep missing!

| AQUARIAN LANGUAGE | #AQLANGUAG
\-------------------/

Throughout Aquaria, you will find messages scrawled on rocks and cavewalls in
the background. These are actually real messages, written in a language made
up for the game. It is a simple symbol = letter swapout process to decipher
them, however I have little interest in doing so and probably never will. I
have been told some of them reveal interesting clues, however.

You can see an example of the symbol swapping going on on the title screen.
As it loads, all the options (New Game, Continue, Options, Mods, etc) will be
in Aquarian, which will fade to English after a few seconds. Neat!

| RECIPE LIST | #AQRECIPEL
\-------------/

Here I will list all 12 1/2 pages of recipes from the game. These are always
recorded in the same order, so that is the order I will list them.

To find new recipes in-game, either pick up a new food item, from a fallen
enemy or song plant, or from simply creating it from this list! When following
a recipe you do not have in-game, the result will be shown as a question mark.
However, following the recipes here, you will have success each time!

Special thanks to various members of the Bit Blot forum for finding the ones
I couldn't find in-game - you guys rock!

Note that this is really just for completionist purposes - there are 3
different recipes for Poison Loaf, and 2 for Veggie Soup. These are just left
over from developing the game, and you really don't need more than one of
each in your book, unless you really want your book to be full. In which case,
follow the guide below.

Also worth noting is recipes such as Poison Loaf 2 and Rotten Cake - that loaf
is listed as Rotten Meat + Anything, and Rotten Cake is Rotten Meat + Sea
Cake. Therefore, the "anything" in Poison Loaf really just applies to anything
that isn't used in another recipe. It's nothing to worry about really, just
make sure you read through all the recipes before making any of the "Anything"
recipes.

| TREASURE LIST | #AQTREASUR
\---------------/

Here's a list of all the collectable treasures in the game, and their
locations.

They are listed clockwise, in accordance with where they appear in the in-game
treasure menu. This will allow you to fill in any unknown holes easier.

Note I will not be explaining what the treasures do, here - look in Naija's
House once you collect them to find out. I will list the uses of the costumes,
though, as they have actual gameplay value.

Here goes!

| find this doll.                                                 |

| As soon as you enter Mithalas City, head up at the crossroads,  |

| The Kelp Forest | Sun Form (Technically)                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| At the very top of one of The Kelp Forest maps, the one with    |
| the hidden, seemingly unreachable cave in the middle of the     |
| map, you'll find a Bigmaul enemy. To the right of that, you'll  |
| find an apparently unreachable cave - but if you swim up        |
| through the fake ceiling, you'll find the Odd Container hidden  |
| in a room of darkness.                                          |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| In this cave, hidden in the very left of The Veil, you'll find  |
| a bunch of rocks blocking a passage, which contains this very   |
| treasure.                                                       |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| In the very very lefthand side of The Abyss is a circular       |
| cavern full of Spiny Crabs. Further through this cavern is a    |
| large empty one full of glowing plants - this seed is at the    |

| Once you have Nature Form, come back to this cave. In the very  |
| bottom left you'll find a giant anemone on the ceiling - swim   |
| through it, and keep charging upwards to fight the current,     |
| and eventually this treasure will be yours.                     |

| In the Open Waters map just below The Veil, the one after the   |

| In the most complicated of The Kelp Forest maps, the one        |
| containing the passage to the boss, you'll find this thing in   |
| the passage full of currents and upside-down jelly trampolines  |

| PETS LIST | #AQPETSLIS
\-----------/ 

Pets, in Aquaria, are tiny little critters that follow you around and help you
out in some way. There are 4 Pets in total, and while 3 of them aid you in
combat, the remainder is a type of support pet. You can instantly change which
pet you have active by clicking their egg in the menu. When you find a pet egg,
wait around for it to hatch, otherwise it will not count as collected!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby Nautilus
Location:       Home Waters
Required Forms: None, although Energy is suggested. Also need Bind Song.
Guide:          To the south and west of Naija's house is an open cave, blocked
                by a rock. Bind this rock to move it, then swim in. Swim up,
                and you will meet the miniboss, Nautilus Prime. Defeat it (see
                Nautilus Prime under minibosses for a guide), and the Baby
                Nautlis egg is your reward!
Stats:          The Baby Nautilus follows you around, spinning wildly into any
                enemies you go near. So cute.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby Piranha
Location:       Mermog Cave
Required Forms: Beast, Energy
Guide:          In the most upper-right of the most upper-right Kelp Forest
                map, you will find Mermog Cave, blocked by a current. Swim
                through with Beast Form, take out the Mermog therein, and at
                the back you will find their leader, Mergog!! Defeat him (see
                Mergog guide under minibosses) and you will be rewarded with
                the Baby Piranha pet.
Stats:          The Baby Piranha will latch onto any enemies it goes near, and
                bleeds them dry over time. It is pretty glitchy, however, and
                enemies that walk quickly (ie: Mermog) seem to outpace the
                Piranha, making it useless. However, for slow or stationary
                enemies, it is great.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby Blaster Peg
Location:       Energy Temple
Required Forms: Energy, Nature
Guide:          In the long, Blue Jellyfish-filled corridoor after the boss,
                you'll come across a red plant. Hit it with a Nature Form seed,
                and drag the pearl that comes out back the way you came, to a
                little passageway in the roof. Inside is a Pearl Socket, plant
                the pearl therein, light it up and proceed into the Blaster
                Peg Prime's domain. Defeat the boss (check the Blaster Peg
                Prime's guide for more info) and the egg is yours!
Stats:          The Baby Blaster Peg hovers around Naija, and fires 3 pink
                slightly-homing blasts at nearby enemies. It seems to reload
                fairly slow, and enemies tend to have to be very close to
                attract the wrath of the Peg, but it makes a nice change from
                the Nautilus for a while.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dumbo Octopus
Location:       Octopus Cave
Required Forms: Sun, Fish
Guide:          In the right side of The Veil, the side that contains the Sun
                Temple, head to the lower left area. There is a Fish Tunnel
                there. Go through it to enter an enemy filled cavern, followed
                by a darkness + electric jellyfish filled cavern, followed by a
                giant octopus boss. Finish him off (check out the Octopus Prime
                guide for hints) and the Dumbo Octopus pet is yours!
Stats:          The Dumbo Octopus is arguably the least useful pet in the game.
                He does not attack, but does have a light aura around him,
                allowing you to kind of see in darkness filled areas without
                using Sun Form. However, Sun Form is not exaclty hard to use,
                so I'd stick with one of the other pets if I were you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/----------------\
| VERSE EGGS LIST| #AQVERSELI
\----------------/

Verse Eggs increase your maximum health, making them a much sought-after
item. When you do find a Verse Egg, switch to regular form and sing the same
colour the egg is to crack it. There are 5 Verse Eggs in the world of Aquaria,
and using this guide it should be a piece of cake to find them all!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1
Location:       The Song Cave
Reqiured Forms: None, but need Bind Song
Guide:          Right next to the crystal where you learn the Bind Song,
                go down into the chasm and Bind the rock there. Drag it
                out of the way and swim under where it was, and the first
                Verse Egg is your reward.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2
Location:       The Kelp Forest
Required Forms: Nature, Energy, Fish
Guide:          Located in the upper left Kelp Forest map, in the mid-right
                passage way you will find an empty Pearl Socket and a locked
                door. Nearby, you will find several closed red plants. Fire
                a Nature Form seed at them, and they will open, revealing a
                pearl. Drag this to the socket, light it up with Energy Form,
                then proceed down the tunnel, then through a fish tunnel,
                to find the Egg.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3
Location:       Open Waters
Required Forms: Fish
Guide:          Located in the most upper of the Open Waters maps, in the top
                left, just before the passage to The Kelp Forest, you'll find
                a tiny fish tunnel in the uppermost wall. Swim through, then
                follow the tunnel past the wrecked crates to find the Egg.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4
Location:       The Abyss
Required Forms: Sun
Guide:          Located inside the Whale in the bottom left part of the right
                side of The Abyss. Sing the whale song (red, blue, purple,
                blue, bluegreen) for entry, and the Egg is halfway along.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5
Location:       Bubble Cave
Required Forms: Spirit, Nature, Beast
Guide:          Located right at the top of Bubble Cave. Defeat the
                Mantis Shrimp Prime to obtain. See optional boss guides for
                hints.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/------------------\
| LOST MEMORY LIST | #AQLOSTMEM
\------------------/

There are 3 lost memories to find in Aquaria, each one will reveal a little
about Naija's mysterious past, and collecting all 3 will allow you access
to hidden cutscenes at the end of the game. To collect a memory, simply go to
where it is hidden and watch the cutscene.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1
Location:       Mithalas City (Ruins)
Required Forms: Energy
Guide:          Head down at the first split, then hug the wall above you. At
                the next turn, keep hugging it to find an open house that looks
                different from the others. Head inside to unlock this memory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2
Location:        The Sun Temple/The Veil
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3
Location:       The Abyss
Required Forms: Energy, Sun, Whale Song
Guide:          Head to the giant Whale, in the bottom left part of the right
                side of The Abyss. Sing the Whale Song (red, blue, purple,
                blue, bluegreen) to get inside. At the back, you will find an
                octopus sitting down. If you wait a while, he will sing
                a tune (red, purple, yellow, bluegreen). Exit his little
                house, and pay attention to the lanterns dotted around the
                area. Charge Sun Form and release near one, and it will light
                up, and play a note. You must light the lanterns up in the
                same order that the octopus sung. That order is:
                - The one above the house the octopus is in.
                - The one far to the right, inbetween three ruined houses.
                - The one to the left of the last one.
                - The one to the left of that, below the Chateu de Octopus.
                The game will play a tune to let you know you did it right.
                Head back to the octopus, and the door behind him containing
                a pearl will now open. Bind the pearl, and head aaaaaaaaall
                the way to the empty pearl socket, which is at the end of
                the dead end, directly above the fork in the path that
                leads to the whale, on the map. It is not hard to find
                the dead-end on the map. Anyway, drag the pearl there, light
                it up with Energy Form, and the memory is yours!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/-----------\
| SONG LIST | #AQSONGLIS
\-----------/

Here's a quick list of the songs you get throughout Aquaria. You cannot sing a
song before you find it in-game, even if you know the notes. Therefore, this
section is really just for completionist purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SHIELD SONG | BROWN - BLUE - BROWN - BLUE
                The Shield Song is the first song you learn, given to you
                automatically. It surrounds you in a protective shield, which
                can reflect some energy blast attacks. It does not, however,
                protect you from physically touching an enemy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BIND SONG | GREEN - AQUA - BLUE
              The Bind Song does just that, it binds an item to Naija. Usable
              items include rocks of the small or large persuasion, small
              plants, creatures shells, etc. Experiment with it, as it will
              be one of your most used songs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ENERGY FORM | YELLOW - BROWN - ORANGE
              The Energy Form allows Naija to hurl blasts of energy at her
              foes using the right click or ctrl buttons. If you hold the
              the button down, Naija charges up, and when fully charged, she
              can launch three blasts at once. These blasts also home in, and
              you can even lock onto a specific enemy by hovering the cursor
              over them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BEAST FORM | RED - ORANGE - BROWN
              Beast Form allows you to swim against any current, and you can
              attack enemies by sprinting through them. Any enemies killed this
              way will be consumed, and a lot of them will be recycled into
              bullets - Beast Form has ammo limited to what you eat. For
              instance, eating Toads gives you a short supply of their Ricochet
              shots. Eating Moneyee Squid and their nests gives you a supply of
              Moneye Squid to launch. However, the main ability is swimming
              through currents. Beast Form is mapped to number key 3 by
              default.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| FISH FORM | GREEN - RED - ORANGE - PURPLE
              Fish Form is the fastest form in the game. Using it makes long
              distance travel a lot easier and less frustrating.
              It also allows Naija to travel through tiny cracks, granting her
              new shortcuts and also access to a lot of new areas.
              Naija also mentions certain enemies will ignore her in Fish Form,
              however I've only really noticed this in one or two enemies.
              The last new ability is Bubbles. Naija's Fish Form can blow tiny
              little bubbles, which can catch a small handful of specific
              creatures inside. This is practically useless in itself, but
              there is a food item that makes these bubbles poisonous for a
              short time - making them a potent weapon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| NATURE FORM | ORANGE - GREEN - PURPLE
              Nature Form is pretty specialist, having only a few very specific
              uses. The right click move launches a seed, which sprouts into
              a few flowers on impact. This does no damage to enemies, but can
              be used for two things: 1) They open those blue bulbs you may
              have seen laying around, allowing you to travel between them, and
              2) They allow you to open those large red flower bulbs. Charging
              up the right click before releasing causes the seed to sprout
              into a large thorn, which can damage enemies, and launch Naija
              if positioned correctly.
              Nature Form can also pass through a few natural boundaries, like
              anemones, without harm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SUN FORM | GREEN - RED - GREEN - RED
              In Sun Form, Naija constantly gives off a large circle of light,
              more than enough to light up dark areas on its own. She also
              propels a shaft of light in the direction she is swimming.
              Her right-click charge ability blasts the whole screen with
              light, which fades over several seconds. This makes navigating
              dark areas a breeze!
              Unfortunately, she is defenseless in this form, which means
              changing forms a lot in hostile, dark areas.              
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| SPIRIT FORM | RED - PURPLE - BLUE
              Spirit Form turns you into just that, a spirit. The world stops,
              and you can even see Naija's body frozen in time. The spirit
              can only move a certain distance away from Naija before
              automatically transporting back. The Spirit Form's main use is
              passing steam currents, through use of the handy blue gems
              always located nearby. Turning into a spirit, then swimming past
              the vents, approaching the blue gem, and right clicking, will
              transport Naija's solid body through the vent and to the gem.
              The second, nearly unknwon use, is the right click can also
              disperse any energy blasts incoming to you. This makes some boss
              fights a lot easier, but it's not really needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| LI SONG | RED - GREEN - AQUA
              Singing the Li Song will call Li close to you, if he is not on
              the screen when you sing it. If he is, it will enable or disable
              his attack mode. Useful if you are trying not to attract unwanted
              attention, or if you want him to back you up in a fight!
              Note that Li cannot keep up with Fish or Beast Forms very well,
              but on a map change he will catch up regardless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| DUAL FORM | TEAL - PURPLE - RED - ORANGE
              Dual Form is quite interesting. It is actually two seperate
              forms, hence the name. The one you start in is Li's form. It is
              kinda greenish blue. Right click alone does not do anything, but
              if you charge it up like Energy Form, it releases several large
              blue shots that travel in a straight line. It is very powerful,
              but lacks the lock-on effect of Energy Form. However, if you kill
              three enemies with this, you will absorb their life essence.. or
              something, and you'll hear a scream.
              Now, if you Spin in Li's Form, you'll turn into Naija's Form.
              This form is pink. Because Naija's a girl. And girls like pink.
              Good job, Bit Blot.
              Naija's Form is defenseless on its own, but after killing three
              enemies in Li's form, then charging a right click and releasing,
              Naija will emit a scream that will kill, or at least severely
              damage, all enemies on screen, plus a few that aren't even on
              the screen.
              This is the most devestating attack you can do in the game, but
              because of the buildup required it is really only useful in a few
              specific situations.
              Spin in Naija's Form to turn back into Li's Form, if you didn't
              guess already.

| GENERAL HINTS | #AQGENHINT
\---------------/

This is just a collection of a few helpful hints I or others have discovered.
If you have any you think should be here, but aren't, email me and I'll give
due credit.

- Forms can be changed using the keyboard, rather than singing. This is not
  required to beat the game - I did not know about it during my first run
  through the game, however it does make things roughly 4923 times easier.
  1-8 change forms, and 9 and 10 are the Shield and Bind song respectively,
  so long as you are in Naija's default form.

- Right clicking a save point, even if you do not use it, adds it to the
  map and, more importantly, refills your health. Always tap a save point when
  you swim past, even if you don't need to save.

- In Energy Form, the default charge shot launched 3 high powered blasts at
  your foes. However, if you sprint twice in any direction, during the little
  roll that Naija does, if you release the charged shot then, you fire 4
  blasts! Similarly, if you are attatched to a wall while firing, you will
  also launch 4 blasts. If you combine these two, and fire a charged shot
  after firing off a wall and rolling, you will fire 6 blasts at once! Make
  good use of this against tougher enemies later in the game.

- Spinning in place not only messes with bubbles and turned gears, it also
  draws in fallen items such as ingredients or even the little blue health
  sparkles. Handy when many drop at once and you are in a rush.

- One of Fish Form's listed abilities is "certain enemies ignore you". This
  is in fact true, although it is very limited. So far the enemies I have
  noticed that ignore you are:
  - Sea Dragon
    Castle Crab
    Starmie
    Mosshead
    Chomper
  However, these are very annoying enemies, so it is worth keeping in mind.

- While in Beast Form, consuming the various shoals of fish that swim
  harmlessly around Aquaria's oceans can refill your health. This is handy
  in a pinch, so remember it!

| CLOSING BLURB | #AQCLOSING
\---------------/

Well, that's it. I'm not sure if there are any sections I've missed, but I've
pretty much covered everything about Aquaria that I can possibly think of.

I'd just like to thank, first and foremost, Alec Holowka and Derek Yu for their
outstanding work on Aquaria, the hands-down best indie game, and one of the
best games in general, that I've ever played. Thankyou for the enjoyment I have
amassed through my various playthroughs!

And thanks to family and friends yadda yadda, although no one has really given
any support while I've been writing this >:(

And actual thanks to the guys over at the Bit Blot forums! Without you this
guide would be not-really-so-complete as it is.

Aaaand.. that's it! Hope to see each and every one of you when Aquaria 2: The
Online Adventures is released!

For real, guys.
